Named after Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (April 19, 1795 ¿ June 27, 1876), German Naturalist, Zoologist, comparative Anatomist, Geologist, and Microscopic, one of the most famous and productive scientists of his time. Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg was born in Delitzsch, near Leipzig. He first studied theology at the University of Leipzig, then medicine and natural sciences in Berlin and became a friend of the famous explorer Alexander von Humboldt. In 1818, he completed his doctoral dissertation on fungi. Ehrenberg was appointed professor of medicine at Berlin University in 1827. In 1829 he accompanied Humboldt through eastern Russia to the Chinese frontier. After his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms, which until then had not been systematically studied. For nearly 30 years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new species, among them well-known flagellates such as Euglena, ciliates such as Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum, and many fossils, in nearly 400 scientific publications. He was particularly interested in a unicellular group of protists called diatoms, but he also studied, and named, many species of radiolaria and forminifera.","Position: South East Pacific

The Committee considered that the feature is a Guyot rather than a Seamount, as proposed, because it has a flat top about 6 km across.
In the Chinese legend, Fangzhang is one of the seamounts in the ocean where the gods live, and it is said people could get magical medicine from gods.

At an early age, he accompanied his father on several scientific expeditions, including James Cook''s second voyage to the Pacific. His report from that journey, A Voyage Round the World, contributed significantly to the ethnology of the people of Polynesia and remains a respected work. As a result of the report, Forster was admitted to the Royal Society at the early age of twenty-two and came to be considered one of the founders of modern scientific travel literature.","Position: South East Pacific

He obtained a PhD in Geology from the university in Berlin, then became a voluntary teaching assistant at the Mineralogical and Petrographic Institute in Berlin. He had strong polar interests and organised geological and glaciological expeditions to Sweden, Norway and Iceland between 1924 and 1934. In summer 1938 he used the new slow-flying Fieseler Storch aircraft to undertake a photographic exploration of the geography of Svalbard, publishing a travel report as a popular book, and making the first coloured aerial movie in the Arctic. Herrmann also had a special interest in volcanoes, and was appointed a member of the Santorin-Expedition to investigate the eruption of one the volcanoes of the Mediterranean island of Santorini, in 1925-1926. He later participated in expeditions to volcanoes in Iceland and Italy (in 1932, 1936, 1937, and 1939). Herrmann described himself as a teacher and polar researcher. Having been wounded during the first World War, he was exempt from military service in the second. As a member of the Freemasons he was not a member of the National Socialist Party and as a consequence was never promoted as teacher. In addition to teaching, he published books and papers and gave lectures and radio broadcasts on geology and geography. His later books included""Die Pole der Erde""(The Poles of the Earth; 1950) and""Die Werkstatt Vulkane""(The Volcano Workshop; 1963). In 1947 he became docent of geography in Bederkesa and at the teacher training college in Celle, and later in Osnabrück.","Minimum depth: 1500 m; Maximum depth: 3750 m; Total relief: 2250 m; Dimension/Size: length ~90 km; continuous trough with steep sides, >25°.","LINESTRING (2.115 -69.81, 2.143333333 -69.7725, 2.243333333 -69.72916667, 2.188333333 -69.67166667, 1.953333333 -69.59416667, 1.736666667 -69.38833333, 1.466666667 -69.26, 1.311666667 -69.1)",

He had the choice of either advancing northwards as far as possible along Greenland's east coast or to reach so-called Gillis-Land by travelling around Spitsbergen. But adverse conditions and strong ice floes prevented him from reaching both destinations. Finally he reached his northmost latitude of 81°5' near Spitsbergen and returned.

He was a seasoned polar whaler - 47 years old - who had sailed most of the seven seas. The season before (1937/1938) he had been Fangleiter (whaling manager) on the German whaling ship Jan Wellem in the Antarctic. Kraul started his career in whaling as a worker at the whaling station of the Compania Argentina de Pesca in Grytviken during World War I. Then he became seaman on a whale catcher, was promoted pilot, and later in the 1920s sometimes held the well-paid position of whale shooter. In1928 he earned his captain's ticket. Theoretical learning was not his strong point, and in his final examination he failed in physics, meteorology and oceanography, passing the other subjects with the lowest possible grades. Kraul¿s strengths were practical, and he could tell the most exciting stories about his experiences. His life story up to and including his experiences on the Schwabenland was published as: Kraul, O., 1939, Käpt'n Kraul Erzählt. F. A. Herbig, Berlin, 240 pp. Kraul's experience of sailing steel hulled ships unprotected against ice in icy seas was invaluable to Ritscher, the leader of the expedition, and got the ship out of some difficult situations when the ship was manouevering among sea ice close to the coast. Avoiding ice was imperative as the main task of the expedition was to launch aerial survey aircraft (seaplanes) to map Dronning Maud Land for the first time (the major achievement of the expedition). The Schwabenland was a catapault ship borrowed from Lufthansa who used it for the South America mail run. But the returning seaplanes had to land on water - hence the need to avoid sea ice at all costs. On one occasion Schwabenland was nearly crushed by sea ice, until Kraul found the leads that would enable her to escape. Schwabenland made major bathymetric discoveries including undertaking the first N-S echo-sounding transect down the mid-Atlantic Ridge in the S Atlantic, and one of the first echo-sounding crossings of the ridge, complementing the set made by Meteor in the 1920s. It also unwittingly discovered the Enderby and Weddell Abyssal Plains. The echo-sounding profiles were published in 1958 as a contribution to the IGY.","Minimum depth: 2200 m; Maximum depth: 3700 m; Total relief: 1500 m; Dimension/Size: length ~80 km; continuous trough with steep sides, >20°.","LINESTRING (2.475 -69.95, 2.5 -69.71666667, 2.325 -69.51666667, 2.145 -69.455, 2.155 -69.36333333, 2.113333333 -69.21333333, 1.976666667 -69.06666667)",

Named after the Mapuches, a group of indigenous inhabitants of south-central Chile and southwestern Argentina. They constitute a wide-ranging ethnicity composed of various groups who shared a common social, religious and economic structure, as well as a common linguistic heritage. Their influence extended between the Aconcagua River and Chiloé Archipelago and later eastward to the Argentine pampa. Historically, Mapuches were known as Araucanians (araucanos). They resisted heavily the conquest attempts by the Spanish and the Incas. The Mapuches make up about 4% of the Chilean population, and are particularly concentrated in Araucanía Region, which is located 600 km south of Santiago de Chile and north of the city Valdivia. Mapuche Ridge is located approx. 1000 km off the Araucanian Region of Chile coast.hes were known for Araucanians (araucanos).","Position: South East Pacific

Named after Matthew Fontaine Maury, born near Fredericksburg, Virginia, 14 January 1806; died Lexington, Virginia, 1 February 1873. Maury is considered as one of the fathers of global ocean mapping. From 1868 he was professor of physics at Virginia Military Institute United States, until his death. Maury¿s scientific career began with two articles and a textbook on navigation. These made him an obvious choice for the U.S. Navy exploring expedition, his main interest lay in improving the technology of navigation, for which the science of the earth was more relevant than the science of the heavens. Maury¿s insight that the data on winds and currents in these logs could be brought together to chart the general circulation of atmosphere and ocean was the basis for his chief contribution to science. Maury began to publish his Wind and Current Charts¿beginning with the North Atlantic in 1847¿ and to issue them free to mariners in exchange for abstract logs of the winds and currents of their voyages. The result was a series of charts and (after 1850) accompanying sailing directions that presented a climatic picture of the surface winds and currents for all the oceans. Inspired by the example of Alexander von Humboldt, many men of science in the second quarter of the nineteenth century were devoting their efforts to collecting on a large scale the data of physical phenomena on earth.
Maury¿s scientific achievements were organizational and empirical like those from Humboldt; they earned him the praise of European leaders of science, including Humboldt. Beginning with an article on the Gulf Stream in 1844, Maury developed theories of the general circulation of atmosphere and ocean, first in articles and in Explanation and Sailing Directions to Accompany the Wind and Current Charts (1850 et seq.) and then in his best-known work, Physical Geography of the Sea (1855).","Position: South East Pacific

He studied in Pisa at the Regia Scuola Normale Superiore where he obtained a degree in Mathematics and in Physics in 1940 and got a University teaching qualification in Earth Physics in 1948. In 1949 he founded in Trieste the Osservatorio Geofisico Sperimentale (OGS) and was its Director until 1963 and its President until 1975. From 1971 to his death he was member of the Editorial Board for the International Bathymetric Chart of the Mediterranean (IBCM) and Vice-Chairman of the Consultation Group for Ocean Mapping (CGOM) of IOC. He led also to the compilation (for the IOC of UNESCO) first of the IBCM 1:1.000.000, published in 10 sheets in 1981, and later on (1985-99) of the Overlay Sheets with the gravity and magnetic anomalies, the seismicity and other geological and geophysical parameters. Carlo Morelli has achieved many scientific goals. The largest part of his experimental research is pertinent to Gravimetry. He proposed and led an endeavor which lasted for 20 years: the global gravity net and its standardization, which was officially adopted by the International Association of Geodesy at the Moscow 1971 General Assembly. This reference system (IGSN 71: International Gravity Standardization Net) represents also nowadays a basic instrument for the international cooperation and is universally adopted. Carlo Morelli is the author of 327 scientific papers (215 of which as the only author), mostly in international journals.","Minimum depth: 1855 m; Maximum depth: 4000 m; Total relief: 2145 m; Dimension/Size: 63 km x 18 km.

Named from ¿Niemegk¿, a small city located 60 kilometres west of Potsdam and hosting one of the world famous geomagnetic observatories. The ¿Magnetic Observatory Adolf Schmidt¿ was installed in 1930 replacing the observatory in Potsdam because the expansion of subway lines there led to bad influences. Looking for a new location, the regional government had to agree on a contract imposing that no large industry be installed in the future within 50 kilometre distance to minimize magnetic disturbances. The city fathers of Niemegk signed this treaty even if this meant a limitation for the city¿s development. However, this decision was a success for the science and since then, international competitions repeatedly show that the quality of magnetic measurements is one of the three best worldwide.","Position: West Indian Ocean

Named after Baron Paul Melchior (1926 - 2004), who was born in Belgium and was an exceptional person. He contributed immensely to the development of geophysics not only as an outstanding scientist but also as a great leader. From 1973 to 1991, he served as Secretary General of International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), and was the Honorary Secretary General of IUGG until his death. His tenure lasted so long because he had an extraordinary ability to meet the expectations of his colleagues. One of his successes as Secretary General was the adhesion of China as member of IUGG, for which he showed all his skill in diplomatic matters. During his long and fruitful scientific career, Paul Melchior had been Director of the International Center for Earth Tides (1958-995), President of the Commission of Earth Rotation of the International Astronomical Union (1967-1970), and President of CODATA (1974-1978).","Position: Scotia Sea
