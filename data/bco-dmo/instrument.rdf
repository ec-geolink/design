    <bcoview:acronym rdf:datatype="xsd:string">ADCP</bcoview:acronym>
    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The ADCP measures water currents with sound, using a principle of sound waves called the Doppler effect. A sound wave has a higher frequency, or pitch, when it moves to you than when it moves away. You hear the Doppler effect in action when a car speeds past with a characteristic building of sound that fades when the car passes.
The ADCP works by transmitting &quot;pings&quot; of sound at a constant frequency into the water. (The pings are so highly pitched that humans and even dolphins can't hear them.) As the sound waves travel, they ricochet off particles suspended in the moving water, and reflect back to the instrument. Due to the Doppler effect, sound waves bounced back from a particle moving away from the profiler have a slightly lowered frequency when they return. Particles moving toward the instrument send back higher frequency waves. The difference in frequency between the waves the profiler sends out and the waves it receives is called the Doppler shift. The instrument uses this shift to calculate how fast the particle and the water around it are moving.
Sound waves that hit particles far from the profiler take longer to come back than waves that strike close by. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back and the Doppler shift, the profiler can measure current speed at many different depths with each series of pings.

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">BIOMAPER II is a set of sensors on a long aluminum frame that resembles the tail of a World War II airplane. A research vessel tows the instrument through the water on a specialized tow cable that sends power to the sensors and brings data back to the ship. People use BIOMAPER II to learn about phytoplankton and zooplankton over areas that are too large to study with the traditional net-and-microscope method. Whereas nets can sample areas up to about 5 meters (16 feet) on a side, BIOMAPER II can record data from 500 meters (1,640 feet) or more of the water column at a time. The instrument's standard suite of sensors were chosen for studying plankton: a five-frequency sonar system, a video plankton recorder and an environmental sensor system (ESS, like the one on MOCNESS). The ESS measures water temperature, salinity, oxygen, chlorophyll and light levels. BIOMAPER II also has room for attaching other instruments for specific uses. The instrument's official name is BIOMAPER-II: the BIo-Optical Multi-frequency Acoustical and Physical Environmental Recorder. The Roman numeral II indicates that it's a redesign of the original BIOMAPER, a prototype that was invented and tested in the mid 1990s.

The Bongo Frame was designed by the National Marine Fisheries Service for use in the MARMAP program. It consists of two cylindrical collars connected with a yoke so that replicate samples are collected at the same time. Variations in models are designed for either vertical hauls (OI-2500 = NMFS Pairovet-Style, MARMAP Bongo, CalVET) or both oblique and vertical hauls (Aquatic Research). The OI-1200 has an opening and closing mechanism that allows discrete &quot;known-depth&quot; sampling. This model is large enough to filter water at the rate of 47.5 m3/minute when towing at a speed of two knots.

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">A COastal Ocean Lagrangian (COOL) float measures compass angle, pressure, and temperature and is constructed from a glass pipe 2.2 m long and with an outer diameter of 9.5 cm. The float consists of the glass pipe, electronics, a volume changer (VOCHA) located within the float, vanes  and a compass, a pinger and either a compressee or drop weight. The COOL float is based on the previously designed isopycnal f/h float (Rossby et al., 1994). Glass was used since it has a very small thermal expansion coefficient. Thus, the float will remain on the same density surface even if the temperature and salinity of the water changes but its density doesn't. If a water parcel is displaced vertically, it will either expand or compress due to the change in pressure and not change its potential density. Since the glass float is less compressible than seawater, it will not follow this water parcel. Therefore, a compressee is added to the float to match the float's compressibility to that of seawater. The COOL float has a volume changer (VOCHA) in it to allow the float to follow a water parcel whose density is changing. However, in our short test deployments, we only used the VOCHA for calibration purposes (described later). Eight vanes at a angle to the horizontal and a compass were added to the isopycnal f/h to make the COOL float. As water flows vertically past the float, the vanes will make the float rotate. Measuring the rotation rate with a compass inside the float will provide a measure of the vertical velocity past the float. If the float is isobaric (that is, the float will remain at a constant pressure; it does not have a compressee), the vertical velocity past the float will be mainly due to the vertical velocity of internal waves. However, vanes on the isopycnal COOL float will make it respond to diapycnal velocities instead of vertical velocities. That is, the float will measure only the amount of water flowing past the float whose density is changing. </glview:description>

All SBE 25s can also operate in real-time, transmitting data via an opto-isolated RS-232 serial port. 

Temperature and conductivity are measured by the SBE 3F Temperature sensor and SBE 4 Conductivity sensor (same as those used on the premium SBE 9plus CTD). The SBE 25 also includes the SBE 5P (plastic) or 5T (titanium) Submersible Pump and TC Duct. The pump-controlled, TC-ducted flow configuration significantly reduces salinity spiking caused by ship heave, and in calm waters allows slower descent rates for improved resolution of water column features. Pressure is measured by the modular SBE 29 Temperature Compensated Strain-Gauge Pressure sensor (available in eight depth ranges to suit the operating depth requirement).



The SBE 25's modular design makes it easy to configure in the field for a wide range of auxiliary sensors, including  optional dissolved oxygen (SBE 43), pH (SBE 18 or SBE 27), fluorescence, transmissivity, PAR, and optical backscatter sensors.

The Beardsley Drifters  are near-surface satellite-tracked drifters used for observations of circulation patterns.  They are WOCE-style drifters featuring holey sock drogues. Each drifter has a small (~ 30 cm diameter) surface float with ARGOS transmitter and batteries tethered to a holey sock drogue centered at 15 m below the surface. The drogue, about 10 m tall and 1 m in diameter, is designed to &quot;lock&quot; itself to the water so that the surface float follows the mean water motion at 15 m depth with very little slippage even in high winds. Thus measuring the drifter's position as a function of time provides a Lagrangian measurement of the 15-m ocean current.

It is constructed primarily of fiberglass. Since the early 1990's it has been towed just below the sea surface with acoustic and environmental sensors to provide continuous profiles of the water column acoustic backscattering and target strengths from zooplankton with a size range of ~ 1.5 mm to 100 mm, and sea surface environmental properties (temperature, salinity, and fluorescence). It was first used with a BioSonics dual-beam acoustic system operating at 420 kHz and 1 MHz or 120 and 420 kHz. The environmental sensing system (ESS) was the ESS used on MOCNESS. In 1997 the acoustics were changed to a HTI acousitic system with 120 and 420 kHz transducers. In 2010, two additional HTI transducers (43 and 200 kHz) were added.

Tucker, was not an opening/closing system, but shortly thereafter it was modified so that it could be opened and closed.&amp;nbsp; The original had a 183 cm by 183 cm flexible rectangular mouth opening 914 cm long net with 1.8 cm stretched mesh for the first 457 cm and 1.3 cm mesh for last 457 cm. 152 cm of coarse plankton or muslin netting lined the end of the net. Tucker designed the net to collect animals associated with the deep scattering layers, principally euphausiids, siphonophores, and midwater fish. (from Wiebe and Benfield, 2003). Currently used Tucker Trawls usually have 1-m2 openings and can have a single net or multiple nets on the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

    <bcoview:acronym rdf:datatype="xsd:string">VPR</bcoview:acronym>
    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) is a video-microscope system used for imaging plankton and other particulate matter in the size range from a few micrometers to several centimeters. The VPR is essentially an underwater microscope. It consists of four video cameras (with magnifying optics) synchronized at 60 fields per second (fps) to a red-filtered 80 W xenon strobe (pulse duration = 1 microsecond). The current lens on each camera can be adjusted to provide a field of view between 5 mm and 10 cm. Use of higher magnification lenses is currently being explored for viewing protozoans (&lt;1 micrometer resolution). The four cameras are set for concentric viewing fields so that a range of up to four magnifications can be viewed simultaneously, allowing a wide size range of plankton to be sampled. Depth of field is adjusted by the lens aperture setting, and the volume sampled in each video field ranges from about 1 ml to 1 liter, depending on lens settings. The cameras have been configured for stereoscopic viewing as well.A strobe on the other arm illuminates the imaged volume and flashes 60 times per second, producing 60 images per second of the particles and plankton in the water. The images are then saved internally on a computer hard disk and later plotted. 

&lt;p&gt;Deployment: Most commonly, the VPR is mounted in a frame and lowered into the water from the stern of the ship. Sometimes, a CTD also is mounted next to the VPR to collect depth, temperature, and salinity information at the same time as each video image. The instrument is lowered down through the water to a maximum depth of 350 meters to generate a profile of plankton/particle abundance and taxon group along with temperature and salinity.  In addition to the towed configuration for mapping plankton distributions, it is possible to deploy the VPR in a fixed position (on a mooring) for viewing plankton swimming behaviors in two or three dimensions. The VPR instrument system has been used in both configurations, and deployment on ROVs has been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The Vector Measuring Current Meter (VMCM) is an instrument for obtaining ocean current data.  It is often deployed on moorings for long periods of time (years).  The VMCM employs biaxial propellers and has undergone extensive tests and calibrations (Weller and Davis 1980). It is a well-characterized mechanical current meter and has been used for benchmarking other current meters (e.g., Dickey et al. 1998a). The two sets of orthogonal cosine response propeller sensors directly measure components of horizontal velocity, and direction is determined with a flux-gate compass (estimated resolution of 1.4 and accuracy of 5) to allow rotation of components into geographical coordinates.

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The Sea-Bird SBE-4 conductivity sensor is a modular, self-contained instrument that measures conductivity from 0 to 7 Siemens/meter.  The sensors (Version 2; S/N 2000 and higher) have electrically isolated power circuits and optically coupled outputs to eliminate any possibility of noise and corrosion caused by ground loops. The sensing element is a cylindrical, flow-through, borosilicate glass cell with three internal platinum electrodes. Because the outer electrodes are connected together, electric fields are confined inside the cell, making the measured resistance (and instrument calibration) independent of calibration bath size or proximity to protective cages or other objects. </glview:description>

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The LI-192 Underwater Quantum Sensor (UWQ) measures underwater or atmospheric Photon Flux Density (PPFD) (Photosynthetically Available Radiation from 360 degrees) using a Silicon Photodiode and glass filters encased in a waterproof housing.  The LI-192 is cosine corrected and features corrosion resistant, rugged construction for use in freshwater or saltwater and pressures up to 800 psi (5500 kPa, 560 meters depth). Typical output is in um s-1 m-2.  The LI-192 uses computer-tailored filter glass to achieve the desired quantum response. Calibration is traceable to NIST.  The LI-192 serial numbers begin with UWQ-XXXXX.  LI-COR has been producing Underwater Quantum Sensors since 1973.  

&lt;p&gt;These LI-192 sensors are typically listed as LI-192SA to designate the 2-pin connector on the base of the housing  and require an Underwater Cable (LI-COR part number 2222UWB) to connect to the pins on the Sensor and connect to a data recording device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LI-192 differs from the LI-193 primarily in sensitivity and angular response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;193:  Sensitivity: Typically 7 uA per 1000 umol s-1 m-2 in water.  Azimuth: &lt; ± 3% error over 360° at 90° from normal axis.  Angular Response: &lt; ± 4% error up to ± 90° from normal axis  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;192: Sensitivity: Typically 4 uA per 1000 umol s-1 m-2 in water.  Azimuth: &lt; ± 1% error over 360° at 45° elevation.  Cosine Correction: Optimized for underwater and atmospheric use.&lt;/p&gt;

Constructed of titanium and other non-corroding materials for long life with minimal maintenance, the MicroCAT is designed for long duration on moorings.  

&lt;p&gt;In a typical mooring, a modem module housed in the buoy communicates with underwater instruments and is interfaced to a computer or data logger via serial port. The computer or data logger is programmed to poll each instrument on the mooring for its data, and send the data to a telemetry transmitter (satellite link, cell phone, RF modem, etc.). The MicroCAT saves data in memory for upload after recovery, providing a data backup if real-time telemetry is interrupted. &lt;/p&gt;

The echo sounder transmits and receives sound, accurately measuring the time it takes to leave the sounder, reach the bottom and return to the sounder. It then converts this information into digital or graphic representations of the bottom depth and relief.
The average echo sounder consists of a transmission and reception unit that sends sound signals through the water, receives and decodes information and converts that information into either a graphic or visual form. Attached to the receiver is a transducer that acts as a microphone and a speaker under the water. Sound waves travel at approximately 1500 m/s through the water dependent on water temperature&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lmstechnologies.com/echo_sounder.htm&quot;&gt; more from LMS Technologies&lt;/a&gt;

LIDAR data collection involves mounting an airborne laser scanning system onboard an aircraft along with a kinematic Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to locate an x, y, z position and an inertial navigation system to monitor the pitch, roll, and heading of the aircraft. By accurately measuring the round trip travel time of the laser pulse from the aircraft to the ground, a highly accurate spot elevation can be calculated. Depending upon the altitude and speed of the aircraft along with the laser repetition rate it is possible to obtain point densities that would likely take months to collect using traditional ground survey methods (June 2010 definition from: http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/RESEARCH/RSD/main/lidar/lidar.shtml).The LIDAR transmitter uses a Galium-Aluminum-Arsenic laser which emits energy in pulses at a constant rate and wavelength. The LIDAR has two sounding modes: active and acoustic. 

Note: A LIDAR system was used during US JGOFS Arabian Sea cruises to acquire SST, DOM and fluorometric pigment data, but there are also bathymetric LIDAR systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The light/dark bottle is a way of measuring primary production by comparing before and after concentrations of dissolved oxygen.  &lt;p&gt;Bottles containing seawater samples with phytoplankton are incubated for a predetermined period of time under light and dark conditions. Incubation is preferably carried out in situ, at the depth from which the samples were collected. Alternatively, the light and dark bottles are incubated in a water trough on deck, and neutral density filters are used to approximate the light conditions at the collection depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of net and gross photosynthesis and respiration can be determined from measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration in the sample bottles.  &lt;/p&gt;</glview:description>

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">Bio-Optical Profiling System (BOPS) is an updated version of the BOPS originally developed by Smith et al. (1984) and is used to collect optical data. The heart of the BOPS is a Biospherical instruments MER-1048 Spectroradiometer which measures up and downwelling spectral irradiance and upwelling spectral radiance. The MER-1048 also has sensors for Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR), depth, tilt and roll. In addition, temperature and conductivity are measured with a Sea-Bird CTD, chlorophyll fluorescence is measured with a Sea Tech fluorometer and beam transmission with a Sea Tech 25-cm transmissometer. The Mer-1048 acquires all the data 16 times a second, averages it to four records a second and sends it up the cable to a deck box and a Compaq-286 computer which stores the data on the hard disk. Additionally, a deck cell measures the downwelling surface irradiance in four spectral channels. Also surface PAR is measured continuously using a Biospherical Instruments QSR-240 Integrating PAR sensor. The profile data is commonly filtered to remove obvious data spikes and then binned into one-meter averages.

HPLC instruments consist of a reservoir of the mobile phase, a pump, an injector, a separation column, and a detector. Compounds are separated by high pressure pumping of the sample mixture onto a column packed with microspheres coated with the stationary phase.  The different components in the mixture pass through the column at different rates due to differences in their partitioning behavior between the mobile liquid phase and the stationary phase.

In general a sediment trap has a jar at the bottom to collect the sample and a broad funnel-shaped opening at the top with baffles to keep out very large objects and help prevent the funnel from clogging.  The Indented Rotating Sphere (IRS) Sediment Trap is described in Peterson et al. (Field evaluation of a valved sediment trap. 1993.

The IRS trap consists of four cylindrical modules; a particle interceptor, an IRS valve; a skewed funnel, and an eleven sample carousel (designated IRSC trap).  The key to the trap design is the patented IRS valve located between the particle interceptor and particle accumulator portions of the trap. The valve and carousel are regulated by a TattleTale IVA (manufactured by Onset Computer Corp.) microprocessor and custom software.  The IRS sediment trap was specifically designed to exclude zooplankton (Trull et al. 2008. Deep-Sea Research II v.55 pp. 1684-1695). </glview:description>

A sliding piston inside the core barrel reduces inside wall friction with the sediment and helps to evacuate displaced water from the top of the corer. A piston corer is capable of extracting core samples up to 90 feet in length. </glview:description>

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">A beam trawl consists of a cone-shaped body ending in a bag or codend, which retains the catch. In these trawls the horizontal opening of the net is provided by a beam, made of wood or metal, which is up to 12 m long. The vertical opening is provided by two hoop-like trawl shoes mostly made from steel. No hydrodynamic forces are needed to keep a beam trawl open.  The beam trawl is normally towed on outriggers, one trawl on each side. 
&lt;p&gt;While fishing for flatfish the beam trawl is often equipped with tickler chains to disturb the fish from the seabed. For operations on very rough fishing grounds they can be equipped with chain matrices. Chain matrices are rigged between the beam and the groundrope and prevent boulders/stones from being caught by the trawl. Shrimp beam trawls  are not so heavy and have smaller mesh sizes. A bobbin of groundrope with rubber bobbins keeps the shrimp beam trawl in contact with the bottom and gives flatfish the opportunity to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close bottom contact is necessary for successful operation. To avoid bycatch of most juvenile fishes selectivity devices are assembled (sieve nets, sorting grids, escape holes). While targeting flatfish the beam trawls are towed up to seven knots, therefore the gear is very heavy; the largest gears weighs up to 10 ton. The towing speed for shrimp is between 2.5 and 3 knots.&lt;/p&gt;

Conventional traction winch systems utilize two sheaves with multiple cable grooves to apply this tractive effort via elliptically reeving cable around the two sheaves.  Advancements in sampling instrument packages and vehicles to perform more complex, intervention tasks at greater depths have placed greater demands on the cables and umbilicals linking them to the surface. The traction winch system was designed to address the challenges associated with increased wire or cable tension.

The crab hoop measures 8 inches across and 2 1/2 inches in height and it was hoped that this hoop would allow flatfish, crabs and some finfish to enter while excluding most lobsters. These traps were built by Kelo Pinkham and Jim Lowe, from Boothbay, Maine. Collapsible square fish traps are also available commercially for eel, crawfish and flounder.</glview:description>

The stainless steel sampling box can contain a surface sediment block as large as 50cm X 50cm X 75cm with negligible disturbance. Once the sediment is recovered onboard, the sediment box can be detached from the frame and taken to a laboratory for subsampling and further analysis. The core sample size is controlled by the speed at which the corer is lowered into the ocean bottom. When the bottom is firm, a higher speed is required to obtain a complete sample. A depth pinger or other depth indicator is generally used to determine when the box is completely filled with sediment. Once the core box is filled with sediment, the sample is secured by moving the spade-closing lever arm to lower the cutting edge of the spade into the sediment, until the spade completely covers the bottom of the sediment box.

There is typically a temperature sensor near the intake (known as the hull temperature) to provide measurements that are as close as possible to the ambient water temperature. The flow from the supply is typically directed through continuously logged sensors such as a thermosalinograph and a fluorometer. Water samples are often collected from the underway supply that may also be referred to as the non-toxic supply. Ideally the data contributor has specified the depth in the ship's hull at which the pump is mounted. </glview:description>

A microcomputer controls all phases of the measuring process: pulse generation, data acquisition, reduction, and storage. Software is used to correct sensor output for temperature dependence and an activity coefficient, a function of temperature and salinity, is computed to correct for salinity. (Langdon, 1984.

The LI-6262 is a differential, non-dispersive, infrared (NDIR) gas analyzer. The CO2 and H2O measurements are based on the difference in absorption of infrared (IR) radiation passing through two gas sampling cells. The reference cell is used for a gas of known CO2 or H2O concentration, and the
sample cell is used for a gas of unknown concentration. Infrared radiation is transmitted through both cell paths, and the output of the analyzer is proportional to the difference in absorption between the two (LI-6262 CO2/H2O Analyzer Operating and Service Manual, Publication Number 9003-59, March, 1996, pg 18).</glview:description>

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The the Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI) is a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) sprectoradiometer with calibrations traceable to NIST standards.  The M-AERI measures spectra in the infrared (about 3 to 18 micrometers) range with a resolution of about 0.5 cm-1. It uses two infrared detectors cooled to 78 K by a Stirling cycle cooler to reduce the noise equivalent temperature difference to levels well below 0.1 K.   

&lt;p&gt;The radiometric calibration of the M-AERI is done continuously using two internal black-body cavities, each with an effective emissivity of  greater than 0.998. The mirror scan sequence includes measurements of the reference cavities before and after each set of spectra from the ocean and atmosphere. The absolute accuracy of the M-AERI  calibration is monitored by episodic use in the laboratory of a NIST-certified water-bath black-body calibration target and residual errors in the M-AERI spectral brightness temperature measurements at temperatures typical of the ocean surface and lower troposphere are typically less than 0.03K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interferometer integrates measurements over a pre-selected time interval, usually a few tens of seconds, to obtain a satisfactory signal to noise ratio, and a typical cycle of measurements including two view angles to the atmosphere, one to the ocean, and calibration measurements, takes about ten minutes.  The absolute accuracy of the spectral measurements (when expressed as a brightness temperature) is 20-30 mK. The measured spectra are processed in real-time to generate measurements of the skin SST and air temperature at the height of the instrument to accuracies much better than 0.1K. &lt;/p&gt;

The GPS receiver of the GPS-radiosonde measures a shift in Doppler frequencies using a codeless detection and measurement technique. The measured Doppler shifts are a combination of satellite and radiosonde motion and contain the pertinent information for wind speed and
direction computation. Doppler frequency measurements of up to 8 satellites are sent to the ground equipment using a low bandwidth (1200 baud) digital link. New independent GPS Doppler measurements from the GPS-sonde are provided every 0.5 seconds for up to 8 channels with 24-bit resolution. The ground equipment computes the wind

A frame attached at the top and bottom to the towing wire supported a cylindrical tube 12.7 cm in diameter and 16 cm long, to which a net was attached. In the mouth of the tube was a flat plate (like a stove pipe damper plate),which closed off the cylinder when the net was deployed. When the first messenger released a spring-loaded latch, the plate was rotated 90 degrees, opening the net; a second messenger rotated it another 90 degrees to close the net. A flowmeter at the back of the cylinder recorded flow through the net.&quot; (Wiebe and Benfield, 2003)  The instruments were equipped with No. 2 silk nets (22 strands/cm.) and &amp;quot;oblique&amp;quot; hauls were made at a speed of about 2 knots for periods of 25 to 40 minutes.

A sharp-edged prism cuts cleanly into the sediment to a depth of 15 to 20 cm. The camera is mounted in the top of the prism, and a mirror is used to reflect the sediment image to the camera from the vertical faceplate. Since the sediment is right up against the faceplate, lack of water clarity is never a limitation on this optical method.

It is primarily designed to accurately follow the three-dimensional motion of water parcels within the mixed layer, through a combination of neutral buoyancy and high drag provided by a one meter diameter black drogue. Typical buoyancies of a few grams result in vertical velocities relative to the water of a few mm/s, small compared to the cm/s turbulent velocities in the mixed layer. The float&amp;rsquo;s motion within the mixed layer thus closely imitates that of a planktonic organism.  The float can also profile vertically.  It sends data and receives commands using the Iridium satellite system. The float is designed to accommodate a wide variety of sensors.</glview:description>

Otter boards  are made of timber or steel and are positioned in such a way that the  hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the  seabed, pushes them outwards and prevents the mouth of the net from  closing. The speed  that the trawl is towed at depends on the swimming speed of the species  which is being targeted and the exact gear that is being used, but for  most demersal species, a speed of around 4 knots (7 km/h) is appropriate.

It can be deployed on a variety of instruments such as SeaSoar, Aries, Scanfish, MOCNESS, a bongo net or simple towing frame. The data from an OPC are typically transmitted to a data acquisition computer through two conducting wires in a towing cable at real time, but it can also be modified to have an internal memory. Large amounts of data are produced. The procedures employed by OPC users vary from; i) estimating integrated biomass by integrating the OPC size distributions, ii) comparing size distributions between OPC and net samples, and iii) simply isolating a size region in the OPC size distribution which correspond solely to specific taxa, eg. Calanus spp..

The unit is protected in a long case that contains the majority of the system's electronics, while the optical sensors are located at either end of the case and face in opposite directions (i.e., up and down). These sensors measure the irradiance in units of uW/cm2/nm and the radiance in units of uW/cm2/nm/sr.  Tilt and pressure are recorded at the same frequency as the irradiance measurements (6Hz). The SPMR is accompanied by a deck reference sensor, called the SeaWiFS Multichannel Surface Reference (SMSR). This sensor is equipped with the same 11 wavelengths as the SPMR, and is based on the same electronics. Data acquisition is synchronized between the SPMR and the SMSR and is performed at the same (6Hz) frequency. </glview:description>

WHOI engineers and scientists designed and built the ROV Jason to give scientists access to the seafloor that didn't require them leaving the deck of the ship. Jason is a two-body ROV system. A 10-kilometer (6-mile) fiber-optic cable delivers electrical power and commands from the ship through Medea and down to Jason, which then returns data and live video imagery. Medea serves as a shock absorber, buffering Jason from the movements of the ship, while providing lighting and a bird’s eye view of the ROV during seafloor operations. During each dive (deployment of the ROV), Jason pilots and scientists work from a control room on the ship to monitor Jason’s instruments and video while maneuvering the vehicle and optionally performing a variety of sampling activities. Jason is equipped with sonar imagers, water samplers, video and still cameras, and lighting gear. Jason’s manipulator arms collect samples of rock, sediment, or marine life and place them in the vehicle’s basket or on &quot;elevator&quot; platforms that float heavier loads to the surface. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8423&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;More information &lt;/a&gt;is available from the operator site at URL.</glview:description>

Flow injection analysis (FIA) is an approach to chemical analysis that is accomplished by injecting a plug of sample into a flowing carrier stream. FIA is an automated method in which a sample is injected into a continuous flow of a carrier solution that mixes with other continuously flowing solutions before reaching a detector. Precision is dramatically increased when FIA is used instead of manual injections and as a result very specific FIA systems have been developed for a wide array of analytical techniques.</glview:description>

Named after its designer, Richard D. Methot, of La Jolla, California, it is also called a Methot Trawl.  It is a single net with a large square opening or mouth. The net is deployed from the stern and towed behind the vessel. The Methot uses fine mesh (e.g. 4 mm) but with openings slightly larger than other plankton net systems. The larger mesh size allows the net to be towed at higher speeds. A flowmeter suspended in the mouth of net measures the flow of water moving through the net and allows for the calculation of the volume of water sampled. With its larger mouth and faster speed through the water, the Methot is designed to catch the larger zooplankton that are often missed by other plankton net samplers.

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">&lt;p&gt;An inverted microscope is a microscope with its light source and condenser on the top, above the stage pointing down, while the objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up. It was invented in 1850 by J. Lawrence Smith, a faculty member of Tulane University (then named the Medical College of Louisiana).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Inverted microscopes are useful for observing living cells or organisms at the bottom of a large container (e.g. a tissue culture flask) under more natural conditions than on a glass slide, as is the case with a conventional microscope. Inverted microscopes are also used in micromanipulation applications where space above the specimen is required for manipulator mechanisms and the microtools they hold, and in metallurgical applications where polished samples can be placed on top of the stage and viewed from underneath using reflecting objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The stage on an inverted microscope is usually fixed, and focus is adjusted by moving the objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The focus mechanism typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment. Depending on the size of the microscope, four to six objective lenses of different magnifications may be fitted to a rotating turret known as a nosepiece. These microscopes may also be fitted with accessories for fitting still and video cameras, fluorescence illumination, confocal scanning and many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

The gear is composed of fiber netting. Floating pound nets use floating toggles and buoys at the surface and are held taught below the surface using anchors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
A pound net consists of: (1) a net body or crib where the entrapment takes place, (2) a least one mesh heart that helps funnel fish into the crib, and (3) a straight leader or hedging which leads fish toward the crib. Fish swimming along the shore are turned toward the crib by the hedging, guided into the heart, and into the crib where they are removed.

    DME (Dropping Mercury Electrode) - mercury is allowed to flow freely from the reservoir down the capillary and so the growth of the mercury drop and its lifetime is controlled by gravity. (The optional 100 um capillary is recommended for this mode.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    SMDE (Static Mercury Drop Electrode) - the drop size is determined by the length of time for which the fast-response capillary valve is opened, and the drop is dislodged by a drop knocker. The dispense/knock timing is microprocessor-controlled and is typically coordinated with the potential pulse or square-wave waveform. This mode can also used to generate the Hanging Mercury Drop Electrode required for stripping experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

    CGME (Controlled Growth Mercury Electrode) - the mercury drop is grown by a series of pulses that open the capillary valve. The number of pulses, their duration, and their frequency can be varied by PC control, providing great flexibility in both the drop size and its rate of growth. This CGME mode can be used for both polarographic and stripping experiments.

A gold or platinum sensing cathode is polarized against an internal reference and, driven by external partial pressure, oxygen from the environment penetrates through the sensor tip membrane and is reduced at the sensing cathode surface. A picoammeter converts the resulting reduction current to a signal. The size of the signal generated by the electrode is proportional to the flux of oxygen molecules to the cathode.The sensor also includes a polarized guard cathode, which scavenges oxygen in the electrolyte, thus minimizing zero-current and pre-polarization time.With the addition of a meter and a sample chamber, the respiration of a small specimen can be measured.

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">The autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Sentry is a fully autonomous underwater vehicle capable of exploring the ocean down to 6,000 meters (19,685 feet) depth. Sentry builds on the success of its predecessor the ABE, with improved speed, range, and maneuverability. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Sentry's hydrodynamic shape also allows faster ascents and descents. Sentry carries a superior science sensor suite and an increased science payload enabling it to be used for both mid-water and near-seabed oceanographic investigations. Sentry produces bathymetric, sidescan, subbottom, and magnetic maps of the seafloor and is capable of taking digital bottom photographs in a variety of deep-sea terrains such as mid-ocean ridges, deep-sea vents, and cold seeps at ocean margins. Sentry is uniquely able to operate in extreme terrain, including volcano caldera and scarps. Sentry's navigation system uses a doppler velocity log and inertial navigation system, aided by acoustic navigation systems (USBL or LBL). The USBL system also provides acoustic communications, which can be used to obtain the vehicle state and sensor status as well as to retask the vehicle while on the bottom. In addition its standard sensors, Sentry has carried a variety of science-supplied sensors, including the Nakamura redox potential probe, ACFR 3-D imaging system, and the Tethys in-situ mass spectrometer.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Sentry can be used to locate and quantify hydrothermal fluxes. Sentry is also capable of a much wider range of oceanographic applications due to its superior sensing suite, increased speed and endurance, improved navigation, and acoustic communications. Sentry can be used as a stand alone vehicle or in tandem with Alvin or an ROV to increase the efficiency of deep-submergence investigations.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

An unmanned vehicle, Nereus operates in two complementary modes. It can swim freely as an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to survey large areas of the depths, map the seafloor, and give scientists a broad overview. When Nereus locates something interesting, the vehicle’s support team can bring the vehicle back on board the ship and transforms it into a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) tethered to the ship via a micro-thin, fiber-optic cable. Through this tether, Nereus can transmit high-quality, real-time video images and receive commands from skilled pilots on the ship to collect samples or conduct experiments with a manipulator arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Abstract&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The oxygen (O(2)) concentration in the surface ocean is influenced by biological and physical processes. With concurrent measurements of argon (Ar), which has similar solubility properties as oxygen, we can remove the physical contribution to O(2) supersaturation and determine the biological oxygen supersaturation. Biological O(2) supersaturation in the surface ocean reflects the net metabolic balance between photosynthesis and respiration, i.e., the net community productivity (NCP). We present a new method for continuous shipboard measurements of O(2)/Ar by equilibrator inlet mass spectrometry (EIMS). From these measurements and an appropriate gas exchange parametrization, NCP can be estimated at high spatial and temporal resolution. In the EIMS configuration, seawater from the ship's continuous intake flows through a cartridge enclosing a gas-permeable microporous membrane contactor. Gases in the headspace of the cartridge equilibrate with dissolved gases in the flowing seawater. A fused-silica capillary continuously samples headspace gases, and the O(2)/Ar ratio is measured by mass spectrometry. The ion current measurements on the mass spectrometer reflect the partial pressures of dissolved gases in the water flowing through the equilibrator. Calibration of the O(2)/Ar ion current ratio (32/40) is performed automatically every 2 h by sampling ambient air through a second capillary. A conceptual model demonstrates that the ratio of gases reaching the mass spectrometer is dependent on several parameters, such as the differences in molecular diffusivities and solubilities of the gases. Laboratory experiments and field observations performed by EIMS are discussed. We also present preliminary evidence that other gas measurements, such as N(2)/Ar and pCO(2) measurements, may potentially be performed with EIMS. Finally, we compare the characteristics of the EIMS with the previously described membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) approach.&lt;br&gt;

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance varies significantly with temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiters, temperature sensors, self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thermistors differ from resistance temperature detectors (RTD) in that the material used in a thermistor is generally a ceramic or polymer, while RTDs use pure metals. The temperature response is also different; RTDs are useful over larger temperature ranges, while thermistors typically achieve a higher precision within a limited temperature range, typically 90 °C to 130 °C.</glview:description>

It is designed to track the large-scale movements and behavior of fish and other animals which do not spend enough time at the surface to allow the use of real-time Argos satellite tags. The PAT can be configured to transmit time-at-depth and time-at-temperature histograms, depth-temperature profiles, and/or light-level curves. The histogram duration (1 to 24 hours) and bin ranges can also be configured. PAT archives depth, temperature, and light-level data while being towed by the animal. At a user-specified date and time, the PAT actively corrodes the pin to which the tether is attached, thus releasing the PAT from the animal. The PAT then floats to the surface and transmits summarized information via the Argos system. Argos also uses the transmitted messages to provide the position of the tag at the time of release.&lt;/p&gt;

They are widely used in research, drug discovery, bioassay validation, quality control and manufacturing processes in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industry and academic organizations. Sample reactions can be assayed in 6-1536 well format microtiter plates. The most common microplate format used in academic research laboratories or clinical diagnostic laboratories is 96-well (8 by 12 matrix) with a typical reaction volume between 100 and 200 µL per well. Higher density microplates (384- or 1536-well microplates) are typically used for screening applications, when throughput (number of samples per day processed) and assay cost per sample become critical parameters, with a typical assay volume between 5 and 50 µL per well. Common detection modes for microplate assays are absorbance, fluorescence intensity, luminescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence polarization. &amp;nbsp;From&amp;nbsp;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_reader, 2014-09-0-23.&lt;/p&gt;

    <glview:description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML">&lt;p&gt;ADV is the acronym for acoustic doppler velocimeter. The ADV is a remote-sensing, three-dimensional velocity sensor. Its operation is based on the Doppler shift effect. The sensor can be deployed either as a moored instrument or attached to a still structure near the seabed.&lt;/p&gt;
