# Canonical Identifiers

Identifiers to concepts beyond the scope of GeoLink (e.g. DOI, ORCID) are going to be prevalent in the GeoLink graph. Each identifier may have multiple serializations and it would be beneficial if we adopted one per identifier. See #51 for more.

## ARK

"The immutable, globally unique identifier follows the "ark:" label."
"When embedded in a URL, it is preceded by the protocolÂ  ("http://") and name of a service that provides support for that ARK."
