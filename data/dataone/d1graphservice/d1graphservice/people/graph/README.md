# D1GraphService/People/Graph

The Makefile and set of Python scripts in this directory can be used to process
scientific metadata from a dump of files (located elsewhere), extracting people
and organizations from them, de-duplicating them, and creating an RDF graph for
them.

This won't (easily) run for anyone else.
