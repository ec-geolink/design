Statistics on the number of triples that could be in DataOne.

I processed 5884 documents.

TRIPLES

Which generated 2763 (people) 10636 (organizaiton) 218057 (dataset) triples
(Sum 231456).

Assuming ~250,000 datasets on D1, we'd generate 11,572,800 if the whole graph
where generated.


URIS

Using matching rules:
  People: Same First+Last
