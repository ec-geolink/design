    glview:description "</field>cted monthly observations of water microbial characteristics from each of the FCE LTER sites beginning in February 2001.  Bacteria counts using DAPI epifluorescence, heterotrophic bacteria production with tritiated Thymidine uptake, and algal energetics and chl a using the PAM fluorometer were determined from each of the water samples.  Bacteria counts in Shark River Slough in the freshwater end of the transect revealed highest bacteria numbers upon marsh rewetting after the dry down.  The highest overall count of bacteria was found at the most freshwater point adjacent to the perimeter of the water conservation area but only in March of 2001.  Peak numbers of bacteria in the saline end of Shark River transect occurred in December and July.  There is some evidence that these higher bacteria numbers in the SR transect are associated with higher salinities.   Highest bacteria counts along the Taylor slough transect were observed at the mouth of the Taylor River with peak counts in the wet season in October.  Bacteria densities also increased  from the eastern to western end of the transect in Florida Bay.  Heterotrophic bacterial production did not relate closely bacteria numbers and exhibited highest numbers in the dry season.  There was no discernible relationship between salinity and bacteria production as seen in bacteria numbers.  Monthly observations using PAM fluorometry revealed that brown algae was the greatest contribution to the algal chal a pool and this relationship was consistent across all FCE LTER sites.  Converse to the pattern of bacteria abundance along the Shark River transect, there was evidence that algal biomass decreases from freshwater to estuary.  In the Shark River, algal energetics increased from marsh to estuary as well as in the panhandle region of the Taylor River transect.  From these observations we conclude the behavior of the microbial loop and interactions generated between functional guilds is highly variable along individual transects and between the Shark River and Taylor River transect.  Wet dry season dynamics partially explain temporal variability in microbial dynamics along the individual transects yet responses were unique for each section of the transect as freshwater versus estuarine versus Bay.   Relationships between salinity and microbial parameters in this case, were not easily discerned but were more consistent within the two river transects than between river transects." ;

Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these monthly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with an YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached.

Several perennial taxa, including tree   (Juniperus monsperma and Pinus edulis), shrub (Larrea tridentata) and bunch grasses (Oryzopsis hymenoides (now Achnaterum hymenoides) and Sporobolus contractus)   species, were monitored at 1-3 sites differing in elevation and   topography as well as edaphic variables and annual precipitation.  The   sites represented optimal or marginal/transitional zones for particular   species.  Demographic measurements were made biannually, after the  'wet'  (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons.  For tree and shrub species,   estimates of growth and reproduction were based on branch demography,   with ten branch tips from 10-20 individuals per species per site   repeatedly measured from 1989-1993.   For J. monsperma, P. edulis and L. tridentata,   vegetative growth (i.e., branch growth) as well as reproduction were   monitored. Additional measurements included needle length for P. edulis and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for L. tridentata.  For grasses, basal diameter, leaf length and reproduction were monitored for 100 individuals per species per site. This project, SEV027, contains only data on grass  demography.   Data on other variables and species is contained in  SEV006, SEV024, SEV025, SEV026, and SEV028." ;
