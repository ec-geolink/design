Dragonflies were studied as an indicator group for species dependent on small-scale wetlands. Data on dragonflies and and day-active Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) was collected by using the standard line-transect method. Additionally, several environmental variables were evaluated.

    glview:description """The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data package includes information on the collection of aerial photos, cover maps and GIS data for MERP. Although the actual GIS data is not stored on the KNB, it can be accessed by contacting the Institute for Wetland and Waterfowl Research.
	In order to determine changes in the location and area of the various vegetation types in the experimental cells, low-level aerial photographs were taken of each cell toward the end of each growing season. Vegetation maps were made from each aerial photograph and these maps were digitized by computer using a geographical information system. By manipulating the data, changes in the vegetation present in an area from year to year was established and the areas of each vegetation type in a cell calculated. This information was used, along with data from the primary production and decomposition studies, to estimate total annual production in a cell and maximum amounts of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stored in the vegetation within the cell. Cover maps were also used to determine how much vegetation was being removed by muskrats and to evaluate the cells as habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. In short, the aerial photographs and the vegetation maps made from them were essential for extrapolating the many different types of MERP data to entire cells (Caldwell and van der Valk, 1989).

This data set includes the preliminary litter bag study, collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP.
	The high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989)
	The MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter
compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies. The preliminary litter bag decomposition study of the four dominant emergents in the experimental ponds (Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Scolochloa festucacea, Phragmites communis syn. Phramgites australis) was completed in 1982. This short-term study was developed to allow a better understanding of litter decomposition during the conditioning period on the experimental ponds.

太魯閣國家公園管理處為了瞭解管轄區域內之不同林帶生態植被變化，在楊遠波、張惠珠兩位學者促進下，在1992年於不同海拔高度生態植被帶，分別設置：高海拔地帶之合歡山臺灣冷杉林永久樣區(海拔高度為3,200m，樣區面積為2000m2)、中海拔地帶之臺灣雲杉林永久樣區(海拔高度約為2,000m，樣區面積為1000m2)，與低海拔地帶闊葉林永久樣區(海拔高度約為320m，樣區面積約為500m2)等共計三處，以作為太魯閣國家公園長期監測轄區內不同生態林帶之植物群落變動情形，提供國家公園永續經營管理依據。
目前針對這三處永久樣區曾經施作複查，以進行討論樣區內植物族群動態變化情形較完整資料，則以合歡山臺灣冷杉永久樣區資料為居多。除了1992年楊遠波、張惠珠建立其樣區第一次基本資料以外，張惠珠、古心蘭更是在1998年進行第二次合歡山臺灣冷杉永久樣區每木複查量測工作，以瞭解在相隔六年之久時間下，其樣區內各種植物族群變化情形。然而引起植物群落進行動態變化，除了隨時間歷程促進植物群落進行自我組成結構變動之外，亦會受到棲地環境條件因素影響，如當地區域之氣候變遷、與棲地植被土壤環境等因子而施作自我調整，以維持植物群落物種結構趨向穩定性發展。
因此，本研究目的，係擬以延伸前述1992年與1998年之研究調查監測記錄資料報告內容，進行2009~2010年間之樣區植物物種調查與樣區現場土壤採樣，以瞭解樣區植物群落在歷經近17~18年時程之植物動態演替變化，並研析臺灣冷杉林之植物群落動態演替現象，與氣候變遷、棲地土壤環境間影響之相關性，以瞭解氣候變遷與棲地環境特色對於樣區植物群落演替特性，作為國家公園對於高海拔植物生態之永續經營管理的參考。""" ;

    glview:description "This dataset is the age 99 Martha Creek Site of the 1KCS study.  We examined stand-level and within-tree structural diversity along a 1000-year chronosequence of temperate coniferous forests. Eight stands were established in the southern Washington Cascades Range in 2000, spanning ages of 50 to 950 years old.  Within each stand, randomly located transects were laid out in proportion to the dominant tree height for the stand.  Tree heights and diameters ranged up to 90 m and 309 cm.  A total of 5,737 trees among the 32 transects were mapped and measured for height, diameter, crown height, and four crown radii.  The structure of the canopy develops from a simple, fairly even monolayer in the youngest stands to a very complex, highly diffuse canopy with extreme variability in both horizontal and vertical dimensions.  The stands with the highest component of structural complexity were aged between 500 and 650 years and retained from 17 to 76 Pseudotsuga/ha.  Mean diameter of just the Pseudotsuga trees was less than 55 cm for stands less than 200 years, rising to means over 180 cm for the most complex old-growth stands.  One measure of stand structural diversity used was the standard deviation of dbh, which ranged from values less than 25 for stands less than 200 years to values in excess of 50 for the most complex old-growth sites.  A similar, but slightly weaker relationship was also present when using the standard deviation of height.  Large snags and logs important for wildlife were only abundant in the old-growth, with abundance highest in the most complex stands." ;

    glview:description "DOCTORATE DISSERTATION: A study of the ecology of the pine marten (Martes americana) was conducted at Sagehen Creek, California from June 1981 through September 1983 Eleven marten were live-trapped  and fitted with radio collarsThese data were used to investigate movement patterns, den use, and habitat preferencesWhen all data were considered, an activity peak in the early afternoon hours was observed.  Males were more active than females at night. Marten were more active during the day in the snow-free season than they were during winter, but generally engaged in the same level of nocturnal activity year-round. The average home range size was 1.39km square for males and 1.02km square for females. Extensive intra and intersexual overlap of home ranges was observed. Trees, snags, stumps and logs provided 77 percent of 210 marten dens located. Comparison with availability data indicated that snags, stumps and logs were preferentially selected as resting sites, but trees were underused in proportion to their availability. Stumps were used more often in summer. Snags and logs were used more in winter than in summer. Den re-use was usually by the same marten first occupying the den, but in 4 instances a different individual used the den. Habitat was characterized andtrack plate surveys were completed... Thirty-five of 80 stations had marten visitation rates of over 40 percent The presence of red fir (Abies magnifica), the absence of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), low solar incidence, and low snag density all contributed to higher marten visitation rates in the model. Discriminant function analysis separating sites used by marten from randomly selected sites developed a model... High basal area, downfall cover, living ground cover and log density characterized marten habitatData from the upper and lower Sagehen Creek basin areas were then analyzed separately. Higher basal area, downfall cover, and stump density characterized marten habitat in the upper basin. Higher basal area and downfall cover also characterized marten habitat in the lower basin, as did higher log density and lower percentage of litter ground cover. Shrub-regeneration cover was similar between active marten sites and random sites, but higher on marten rest sitesPrey availability by habitat type was investigated by trapping small mammals Highest levels of deer mice populations were consistently found in brushfield habitat. Within forested habitats, highest levels of deer mice populations occurred in logged red fir forest and lodgepole pine forest. Chipmunks were evenly available throughout all habitat types. Mixed conifer forest had the highest number of ground squirrels in 3 of 4 trapping sessions. Montane voles were most abundant in large meadows and lodgepole pine forest. Mountain phenacomys were trapped in logged red fir forest, uncut mixed fir forest, and mixed conifer forest. Audio censuses of chickarees were conducted along small mammal trap linesChickarees were evenly available in all forested habitats in 4 of 5 censuses. One hundred marten scats were collected. The most common small mammal prey items, measured by percent frequency of occurrence in scats, were montane vole (10.6), chickaree (6.8), and chipmunk (5.8). Summer and winter diets of marten varied only slightly. Chickarees and chipmunks were similarly abundant in habitat preferred by marten and habitat not used by marten. Voles were not abundant in forested habitat, but occurred in relatively high numbers in meadows found within the forested areas frequented by marten. The smallest unit of marten habitat that should be considered by land use planners is 15km squared. Prime marten habitat is found in mature forests dominated by red fir, a mixture of red fir and white fir, and lodgepole pine with a total basal area of 30-60 m squared/ ha. Xeric, mixed conifer forests, especially forest dominated by Jeffrey pine, will not support marten. Downfall cover of 10-20 percent, stump densities of 50-90/ha, and log densities of 20-50/ha contribute to optimal marten habitat within the preferred forest types. Partial timber harvest in the form of selective cutting or small clear-cuts less than 1 ha might increase the suitability of an area for marten by providing more downfall cover in the form of large diameter slash and higher densities of stumps and logs if the site was not burned or intensively prepared for artificial regeneration. Small-area harvest may improve marten habitat, but the immediate effects of logging on marten are unknown. Radio-tagged marten should be monitored throughout the life of a timber sale to evaluate the immediate effects of logging." ;

    glview:description "MASTERS THESIS: Native fish population surveys were conducted in five California streams of the Truckee River system in the western Lahontan Basin in July and August, 1987. Areas sampled were above impoundments in four streams and below an impoundment in Martis Creek. Results were compared to surveys both before and after stream impoundment. Native fishes were virtually absent in Martis creek and scarce in the Little Truckee River. Compared to 1982-83 surveys, fish numbers increased measurably in both Sagehen Creek and Prosser Creek, exhibiting a measure of persistence and resilience to disturbance.  However, in Sagehen Creek, the increased fish abundance was limited to two native species and an area normally inundated by the reservoir. Although, Alder Creek and Prosser Creek supported sizable populations of mountain sucker (Catostomus platyrhynchus) and Lahontan speckled dace (Rhinichythys osculus robustus) in portions of their lower sections, mountain sucker, Lahontan speckled dace, and mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) were generally scarce throughout the five streams. Stream impoundments are suspected of creating conditions leading to the extinction of mountain sucker, Lahontan speckled dace, and mountain whitefish in upstream areas. Principal reasons are loss of habitat, greater environmental variability from fluctuating reservoir levels, and increased barriers to migration." ;

    glview:description "DOCTORATE DISSERTATION: This thesis explores the contribution of the environment to the Song Sparrow pattern of geographic variation. In chapter 1, via the analysis of reciprocal transplant experiments, I address what processes are acting to produce differentiation in Song Sparrow morphology. By comparing the ontogeny of young reared in their native environment to that of young reared in an ecologically differentiated environment, I demonstrate that the bill morphology is particularly plastic, whereas the limbs are not. In addition, it is the body size that is environmentally flexible whereas the growth rate (allometric slope) is relatively invariant. Therefore, environmental variation alone can explain some of the morphological diversity among Song Sparrow populations. This study and others have revealed a lack of concordance in phenotypic plasticity among traits within an organism. The mechanism for this discord has not been described. In chapter 2, I investigate the factors which determine the level of phenotypic plasticity exhibited by specific traits. A multivariate analysis of size and shape of Song Sparrow populations found along the Pacific coast shows that shape variation conforms to geographic barriers and thus may reflect the pattern in which bill characteristics are positively allometric and all other traits are not supports the conclusion that body size is an environmentally plastic trait; morphological characteristics exhibit levels of phenotypic plasticity in proportion to their rate of growth with respect to body size. Because of allometry these traits grow at different rates. Consequently, a change in body size can change an entire suite of traits. Thus local physical environmental factors which alter body size can create striking patterns of morphological diversity among Song Sparrow populations. Based upon behavioral observations the Song Sparrow is believed monogamous. However, molecular analyses often illustrate that social pairings do not reflect patterns of gene flow. Mixed reproductive strategies abound within monogamous social systems. Several avian taxa exhibit geographic variation in mating system. Given the importance of environmental variation to Song Sparrow morphological variation, one might expect behavioral mechanisms to vary also. In chapter 3, I assess the level of behavioral plasticity in two ecologically differentiated populations of Song Sparrow. The rate of extra-pair fertilization can be influenced by the opportunity for the sexes to meet and copulate discretely. Consequently, I predicted that extra-pair fertilizations would be more common in a visually occluded, dense population. However, DNA-fingerprinting reveals no evidence of extra-pair fertilization in either population. Likewise there is no difference in level of parental care or sperm competition in the two populations. These results argue that despite morphological flexibility in relation to local environmental factors, the Song Sparrow is truly monogamous. It is proposed that this strict monogamy is maintained by the constraints of a single pair rearing two broods in one season. Phenotypes result from a complex nexus of interactions between the genes and the environment. The Song Sparrow is morphologically highly variable. A proportion of this variability is environmentally flexible-transplanted young deviated toward the phenotype of the foster population. Consequently, geographic patterns of morphological diversity may not be a direct representation of underlying additive genetic variation. Rather, geographic variation represents the norm of reaction and phenotypic plasticity itself may be the object of selection. In this way, avian phenotypic plasticity may provide alternative morphologies in response to variable selection pressures and thus create patterns of evolutionary diversity." ;

    glview:description """Annual research proposal for A%26#195;%26#177;o Nuevo:  2008
Costa Lab, UC Santa Cruz

The Costa lab seeks to continue the ongoing elephant seal diving and tracking research program.  The data generated in the proposed studies will directly benefit the research projects of seven graduate students, a post-doctoral researcher, an undergraduate, and many Tagging of Pacific Pelagics researchers:

Dr. Dan Costa
Cory Champagne
Jason Hassrick
Autumn-Lynn Harrison
Melinda Fowler
Sara Maxwell
Patrick Robinson
Samantha Simmons
Dr. Yann Tremblay
Nicole Teutschel
TOPP researchers

General project goals include:
1.	Foraging in relation to oceanography; diet reanalysis.
2.	Movement patterns and navigation at various temporal and spatial scales.
3.	Predictive movement modeling.
4.	Age-related differences in foraging behavior and success
5.	Contaminant loading.
6.	Creation of optimal foraging models from diving behavior.
7.	Importance of seamounts to foraging success.
8.	Incorporation of tag data into TOPP database for multi-species analyses.
9.	Fasting physiology in pups and adults
10.	Variation in diet over the first foraging trip to sea.

Methodology:
To address all of these questions while minimizing impacts on animals and the reserve, all researchers will be working in close collaboration with each other and sharing much of the data collected from each seal, thus overall sample sizes will be kept at a minimum while maximizing the amount of data collected and used.
Following the breeding season and molt season of 2008; 20 known-aged, adult female seals will be instrumented with a satellite tag (to follow their movement patterns while at sea), a time-depth recorder (to examine their diving behavior as well as environmental parameters such as water temperature and light level) and a VHF tag (to relocate the animal after return to the rookery).  1 to 2 of these females will be instrumented with a crittercam and accelerometer to detect feeding events. Pending tag availability, up to five additional adult male elephant seals will be equipped with Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) tags to collect oceanographic-quality data.


Additional procedures (and purposes) during instrument deployment/recovery:
1.	Morphometric measurements (lengths and girths) ; Body composition
2.	Ultrasound measurement of blubber thickness ; Body composition
3.	Mass ; Body composition / Foraging success
4.	Blood samples ; Oxygen storage capacity, contaminant analysis
5.	Muscle/blubber biopsy ; Oxygen storage capacity, contaminant and diet analyses
6.	Whisker collection ; long-term diet analysis


In addition to the full deployments described above, up to 15 translocation experiments will be conducted.  Juvenile seals will be captured at A%26#195;%26#177;o Nuevo, equipped with instrumentation, and released either in the Monterey Bay by boat or from Monterey.  These experiments will provide insights to oxygen usage, aide in the movement and navigation studies and assist tag manufacturers with instrument design and testing.

Wherever possible we will work before and after tour hours and out of the direct view of tourists to minimize impacts on the day-to-day operation of the reserve.

Recent publications and tracking data will be available for public viewing at the following websites:

http://las.pfeg.noaa.gov/TOPP/

We welcome an open dialog with respect to our activities at A%26#195;%26#177;o Nuevo.  Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.  Costa Lab:  831-459-2691""" ;

    glview:description """This dataset represents the state of knowledge about the distribution of seafloor sediment for the Southern California continental shelf. The dataset is derived from a map series of seven adjacent but descrete maps illustrating seafloor sediment and rock.

The purpose of this project was to create digital, GIS format versions of the Southern California continental shelf seafloor substrate maps originally produced by PS Associates of Cardiff, California for the Minerals Management Service in Reston, Verginia.

The original data was presented in hard copy format and depicted areas of \"rock outcrop, hard-ground, or less than 1 meter of sediment overlaying.\" In areas where no rock was identified, we designated this as \"sediment\". Note that this is liberal interpretation of the original map data. A more conservative and accurate interpretation involved using \"no data\" maps which indicated the areas in which no information on substrate type was gathered. Please see the \"no_data\" dataset that is part of this series.

    glview:description "The distribution and abundance of macromoth species is strongly influenced by geographical (region-neighboring plots) scale, elevation, aspect, plant community, management regime, and time of year. Patterns of distribution and abundance are based on a total of 503 species, about 300 species may be observed in any given year. Blacklight traps were deployed for one night every two weeks at 12 sites per night from April through October. A total of 263 sample sites occur across the HJA Forest watershed. The watershed can be divided into 13 distinct zones. The northwest ridge above the headquarters has the highest number of species (n = 321) and the lowest number of species occurred at upper Lookout Creek (n = 239). Each of 13 zones is missing ca. 200 of the 500 resident species, suggesting that heterogeneity in the landscape is important. A breakdown of the species into functional groups based on larval feeding habits: conifers, hardwood, herb, mix, unknown shows that 43% of Andrews species rely on a hardwoods; 63% if you include herbaceous angiosperms. Conifer-feeders only represent feed 8% of moth species.  However, moths associated with conifer hosts can be abundant, representing. For instance, in the zone representing the midlevel of Carpenter Mountain 67% of moth individuals are conifer feeders, but only 14% of the species feed on conifers. On the other hand, within the zone represented by the Headquarters site only 32% of the individual moths feed on conifers whereas 56% feed on hardwoods. Ordination analysis demonstrated that sites 23A and 15E (lower Lookout Creek and Headquarters are similar), 23H and 16B (WS 10 and ridge) are similar, 16M &amp; 13F (Carpenter mountain, upper Lookout Creek), 18A and 3B, 26B and 5S, 5L and 17C (Frissel Ridge), and 39B (south facing into McKenzie valley). Hence moth biogeographic zones correspond to elevation zones and to potential vegetation as mapped by Cindy McCain and others for the WNF." ;

Mark Harmon has conducted a survey of coarse woody debris.  Future studies could include hydrology and species diversity.  

When we compared the soil characteristics between slow and expected recovery sites, the only variables showing significant differences were soil moisture, litter depth and substrate induced respiration (SIR) rates at low glucose concentrations.  The litter depth was slightly less, soil moisture lower, and SIR rates higher in the slow sites.  When we compared soils in adjacent uncut forests, we found that field respiration rates were lower in forests adjacent to slow recovery sites than to normal sites suggesting that these sites may have inherently lower productivities.  We concluded that slow recovery after clear-cutting is most likely related to physical site characteristics; i.e. steepness of slope and aspect.

    glview:description "Measurements were made along transects running from mountain meadows, into transition zones where trees were invading meadows and then into mature forest to determine if the invasion of high central Oregon Cascade Mountain meadows by the surrounding forest altered soil properties.  Prior studies shown that meadow soil chemical and biological characteristic change when they are invaded by surrounding trees.   For instance meadow litter has been shown to be enriched in nitrogen when compared with tree litter.  In this study, differences in nitrogen pools and cycling were observed supporting the view that nitrogen is more available in meadow soils than in forests and that these differences change rapidly when tree invade mountain meadows.  As trees invade meadows, ß-glucosidase activity is also rapidly reduced suggesting that qualitative changes are taking place in microbial populations as microorganisms adjust to changes in litter quality.  High correlations between litter depth and most variables suggest that meadow litter may control other aspects of biogeochemical cycling; a relationship not observed in the transition zone or the mature forest.  With one exception, the values observed in the transition zone were intermediate between those in meadows and those in forest soils.  In most cases, the values found in this zone were closer to those found in mature forests than in meadow soils suggesting that when trees invade meadows, soil properties are rapidly shifted toward those found in forests.  These rapid changes may alter soils so that they are more likely to support trees than grass.  This may partially explain why, areas where trees had been cut after they became established as small islands within the meadow are rapidly recolonized by trees rather than grass." ;

This study was designed compare below-ground soil properties with above-ground vegetation and coarse woody debris distribution patterns using three-dimensional response surfaces and to compare soil properties in and outside the gap.  To accomplish this goal, samples were collected along a grid already established by Gray, A.N., and Spies, T.A. (1996) designed to study vegetative succession in tree-fall gaps of varying sizes.  We chose to measure soil characteristics at 4-meter intervals using the Gray/Spies grid design.  The sample grid was essentially a circle centered within the gap. The sample grid was expanded 12 meters into the surrounding forest so that comparisons could be made between soils within the gap and those in the forest.   During the same summer that the soils work was done, Dr. Gray and his students conducted studies of vegetation and coarse woody debris distribution patterns within these same gaps, generating GIS data layers which could be used to directly compare with our soils data. 

As expected, soil temperature and moisture were both higher in gaps.  Soil respiration, labile carbon concentrations, and litter depth were all lower in the gaps as the result of lower net primary productivity (NPP).  The lower Â-glucosidase activities seen in the gaps, probably reflecting lower microbial activities in response to lower carbon cycling rates.  Denitrification potentials were, however, almost twice that in the adjacent old-growth forest suggesting that there was more mineralized N available to denitrifying microorganisms in the gap than in the forest.   This pattern also suggests that even 9 years after the gap was formed, it had not been colonized by sufficient root and mycorrhizal biomass to act as an effective sink for mineralize N.  The low concentration of ectomycorrhizal mats may be symptomatic of this condition.""" ;

In the first survey, forest floor respiration rates were measured at 130 sites covering a large portion of the HJA.  The sample sites were located at 0.5 km intervals along most of the main roads.  In addition to field respiration rates measured by the soda-lime method, soil and air temperatures were recorded along with maximum and minimum soil temperatures for the 24 hr CO2 collection period.  Only one measurement was made per site.  These data and associated metadata can be found in database SP05 under the title of “H.J. Andrews 1993 REU synoptic soil respiration of permanent forest sites”.  

The following summer, a much more comprehensive study was conducted.  The number of sites studied was expended to 183 sites located at 0.5 km intervals along all passable roads on the HJA.  With the exception of the max-min soil temperature data, all variables measured in 1993 were repeated in 1994.  In addition, the following variables were measured: pH, soil moisture, bulk density, soil organic matter, laboratory respiration (both long and short-term; with and without amendments), denitrification potential, extractable ammonium, and mineralizable nitrogen.  In addition, we scored for the presence of moss on the surface and mycorrhizal mats found in 4.7 x 10 cm cores.  These data and associated metadata are located in database SP06 entitled “H.J. Andrews 1994 REU study of soil chemical and microbiological properties”.  The main objective of this study was to provide a broad overview of soil chemical and biological properties to guide us in future large-scale HJA soil surveys. 

In 1998, we conducted another soil survey designed to provide an accurate assessment of soil properties over the entire HJA.  This dataset represents the results of that effort.  Since the 1994 survey, we changed the way we measured soil field respiration rates.  Initially we used the 24 hr soda-lime CO2 adsorption method in chambers with only one measurement per site.  In 1998 we converted to using the Li-Cor® portable respirometer with 5 measurements made per site.  Since 1994, it was also discovered that there were significant edge effects to 30 meters from an edge.  For this reason, all sample locations were moved at least 40 meters from the road.  While conducting autocorrelation analyses, we found that for the variables studied, samples collected at 5 m intervals were not autocorrelated and could thus be considered independent for statistical analysis.  Our subsequent work also allowed us to chose those variables that would most likely be influenced by topography.   

The previous two surveys were conducted in the late summer when the forests are dry and microbial activity at a minimum.  The current study was conduced from mid June to the first of July while the soils were still moist and when microbial activity was more typical of wet months.   In the other two studies, only one measurement was made per site.  In the current survey, replicate samples were collected and pooled or multiple measurements were made in the field.  As a result of experimental design modifications, it is thought that this represents the best and most definitive dataset of basin-scale soil properties on the HJA.""" ;

    glview:description """To better understand the effects vegetation has on forest soils, we established a number of sampling transects running from old-growth (OG) forests into stands with different vegetation or transects within different vegetation types without an OG component.  Each transect was made up of 75 meter segments in both the OG and “treatment” stands.  Soil samples and field observations were made at 5 meter-intervals along these segments.  Where indicated, the OG portion of the transect acted as a pseudocontrol.  The types of vegetation assemblages studied were: (1) a 26 year-old young stand (YS),  (2) 6 sites showing normal to fast recovery (FAST) ranging in age from 29 to 36 years, (3) 5 sites showing slow recovery (SLOW) after clear-cutting ranging in age from 27 to 36 years, (4) 4 degraded (DEGRAD) sites ranging in age from 26 to 35 years, (5) 2 grass sites (GRASS), 26 years and undisturbed, and (6) a bracken fern site (FERN) aged at 26 years.  

Of these, the DEGRAD, GRASS and FERN sites showed much higher levels of denitrification potential than the other sites suggesting that mineralized fixed nitrogen was being lost from these sites at higher rates than the other vegetation types.  Ectomycorrhizal mats were also essentially absent from sites as well.  The concentration of living roots was highest in the YS and GRASS sites. The lowest concentrations of labile or biologically active organic carbon as measured by laboratory respiration rates, was found in the DEGRAD sites.  The lowest levels of mineralizable (labile) organic nitrogen were found in the FERN site. Litter depth was lowest in the YS and GRASS sites and highest in the FERN site.  There were a number of differences found between FAST and SLOW sites that reflected the different NNP activities in these stands.  The concentration of ectomycorrhizal mats was greater in the FAST stands.   Additionally, litter depth, field respiration rates were all greatest in the FAST stands, all of these patterns would be expected from stands with greater NPP.  The concentration of mineralizable nitrogen, extractable ammonium and denitrification potentials were all lowest in the FAST stands suggesting that more organic nitrogen is being cycled and utilized by the faster growing trees.  The higher concentration of mycorrhizal mats in these sites could provide the mechanism for cycling organic nitrogen a more rapid rate that in the SLOW sites where they are not as numerous.""" ;

    glview:description "This study was designed to determine if ectomycorrhizal mats are more likely to be present in soils at the base of common understory trees than in soils distant from trees and to determine if there is a relationship between the occurrence of mats and tree size.  The understory trees studied included the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia Nutt.) western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.)Sarg) and vine maple (Acer circinatum Pursh).  Twelve sites were studied representing a range of climatic conditions and management histories.  More than 2,900 plots were surveyed over an 18-month period.  It was found that the incidence of ectomycorrhizal mats was higher at the base of all three species of trees when compared with control plots.   A statistically significant positive correlation was also observed between the incidence of mats and tree size.  When comparing saplings with larger trees, the saplings consistently had a lower incidence of mats.  These observations are not consistent with the hypothesis that ectomycorrhizal mats are required for T. brevifolia  establishment or survival." ;

We sampled old-growth and mature forests containing conifers and hardwoods to provide data on a range of tree heights.  Hillslope steepness was considered in the sampling because we expected that if debris slid down steep slopes, source distances would be greater at sites with steeper side slopes and narrower floodplains.

For temporal variability, my main objective was to determine if and when the fire regime as shown by fire frequency had changed over the length of the record.  There were several objectives to elucidate the spatial patterns of fire occurrence:  
(1) determine if fires were clustered near each other or randomly dispersed throughout the study area in the past, 
(2) characterize the spatial pattern of site-level fire frequencies, 
(3) determine through regression methods if historical fire frequencies were correlated with topographic variables for the length of the record and for each time period, and 
(4) extrapolate the predicted relationship between fire frequency and topography from the site-level over the study area. 
My secondary goal was to describe the frequency, extent, and severity of the historical fire regime as much as possible within the limitations of the study design.  My objective regarding fire 
frequency was to compare how the study area fire frequency compared to those of nearby studies in the western Cascade Range of Oregon.  For fire extent, my objective was to identify relatively large fires and compare their numbers to that of smaller fires.  My objective regarding fire severity was to characterize general site-level and study area fire severities based on the relationship between fire severity and frequency.""" ;

    glview:description "This study investigates how differences in tree age, stand structure and species composition between an old and young Douglas-fir/western hemlock forest impacts overstory transpiration. We measured sap flow (using constant-heat thermal dissipation sensors) during the growing season in samples of trees in Watershed 1 (harvested in the 1960's) and Watershed 2 (last major disturbance approximately 450 ybp) at the HJ Andrews Forest in the Western Cascades of Oregon. The trees selected for these measurements differ somewhat each year. Sap flow was scaled to the whole tree level (per unit sapwood area) from measurements in outer and inner portions of the sapwood.  We also surveyed vegetation in plots arrayed along transects in a 100m swath centered on the streambed in each watershed, determining the species composition as well as the basal area and sapwood basal area by species.  From the sap flow measurements in the sampled trees and the vegetation surveys, we estimated overstory water use within the 100m swath. We found that differences in water use per unit sapwood area, sapwood area density, and species composition between the old and young forests all result in greater water use by the overstory trees in the younger forest. This may explain some observed differences in stream runoff among forested watersheds and provides some insight into the implications for forest management on water resources." ;

It encompasses nearly 100,000 ha of essentially undisturbed landscape straddling the crest of the central Cascade Range, Oregon.  Coniferous forests dominate the Three Sisters, although the Wilderness also supports a diversity of non-forested habitats including montane and subalpine meadows.  The Three Sisters was given wilderness status in 1957 and was selected as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1974, to represent a \"control\" area for the nearby H. J. Andrews Biosphere Reserve.  Integral to the establishment of a Biosphere Reserve is the documentation of existing ecosystems with baseline data.  However, basic ecological research in theThree Sisters has been relatively limited.  We conducted two types of studies:  (1) phytosociological studies to characterize current vegetation patterns and to interpret relationships between community composition and major environmental and edaphic gradients, and (2) retrospective analyses of the invasion of montane and subalpine meadows by trees with a focus on the effects of recent climatic variation, grazing history, and site environment." ;

    glview:description "This darabase contains data on patterns of fall and breakage by riparian trees along streams in the Pacific Northwest. Data in these tables were collected from 2000-2002. Two tables are included.  (1) site descriptions and (2) tree fall.  The site descriptions table contains information on the geographic location (general physiographic location, political state, and river drainage basin), physical aspects of the channel (active channel width, valley floor width, and channel gradient), and structure of the riparian forest (general age, tree density and basal area, and average tree height/diameter breast height ratio of down trees at the site).  Physical aspects of the channel are average values taken at 20-m intervals within the site except for channel gradient, which are average values for 100-m intervals.  Stand density (treesúha-1) and basal area (m2úha-1) were measured with the point- center quarter method, please see Dan Sobota's Master's thesis for more details.  The tree fall table contains information on individual trees measured at each site in the study.  Species, geomorphic landform of rooting position, streamside location, and type of tree fall (stem break or root throw event) are descriptive variables for each tree.  Tree height, diameter at breast height and diameter at the top of the tree describe tree size.  Side slope at tree base and distance from the active channel describe the physical location of the tree along the stream.  Number of pieces only includes those produced when the tree first fell.  Fall direction is normalized to 0 degrees upstream and 90 degress directly towards the stream for trees located on both stream banks." ;

    glview:description """Ectomycorrhizal mats in forest soils have a wide global distribution and are apparently important to nutrient cycling.  Since little known about the factors influencing their distribution we have conducted one of the first studies attempting to define the factors influencing mat distribution.
We chose to study distribution patterns of mat-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi of the genera Hysterangium and Gautieria in coniferous forests of the Pacific northwestern United States by mapping ectomycorrhizal mats and other forest floor features in 2 x 10 meter plots and digitized into a Geographical Information System (GIS) for spatial pattern analysis.

Distribution was measured in terms of mat size, size variability and shape, total mat cover per stand age, nearest neighbor distances, and correlation with understory vegetation and tree age using the digitized plot mats.  While GIS analysis indicated that Hysterangium and Gautieria did not physically overlap, there appears to be a tendency for clustering of mats.  No apparent correlations were observed between forest floor features and mats located within the 2 x 10 meter grids.  Mat distributions were found to vary temporally; total mat area, size and frequency differed for Hysterangium and Gautieria mats when comparing young, mature and old-growth stands.   The GIS analysis has been reported by Griffiths et. al (1996) and the digitized plot maps on which these analyses were based are available on-line.""" ;

In a region dominated by coniferous forests, montane meadows contribute greatly to landscape diversity, wildlife habitat, and other important ecological functions and societal values. Throughout the Pacific Northwest, suppression of fire and changes in climate and grazing pressure have led to rapid succession of meadow to forest.  Faced by gradual loss of these habitats, land managers have begun to experiment with prescribed fire as a potential restoration tool.  We have initiated a program of research, adaptive management, and outreach that will contribute to our understanding of the dynamics of these systems and to their restoration and maintenance.  Our studies include (1) a retrospective analysis of the spatial and temporal patterns of conifer encroachment and the associated changes in ground-layer vegetation; (2) an examination of the soil seed bank as potential source of meadow species and how it varies with encroachment history, current vegetation, and proximity to open meadow; and (3) studies of vegetation response to experimental restoration treatments, including tree removal and prescribed burning.

    glview:description "This database contains data about the trees, and the tree-ring records collected from them, in a 3.3 hectare plot in an old-growth Douglas-fir/western hemlock stand in the western Cascade Range of southern Washington. The trees were mapped before harvest. After harvest, samples were collected from their stumps, and in some cases, their felled boles. The samples were taken back to the lab where they were prepared, crossdated, and evaluated for the data contained in this database. See references cited below for details about the stand and the collection, preparation and evaluation of samples (Winter et al. 2002a,b; Winter 2000). The data were originally entered into the database program Paradox as multiple files linked by the attributes \"Tag\", \"Height\" and \"Sample\". For the purposes of the present, general- use database, these Paradox files were copied to the text files found here. The present database consists of this document (Winter.doc), an Excel file describing the database's 9 entities and their attributes (Winter.xls), and 9 text files (*.txt) containing the data for the respective entities. In these entities, data about the trees includes: identity (tag number), species,  dbh and mapped co- ordinates. Data about the tree-ring samples collected from these trees includes: identity of tree that the sample was collected from, tree-height (as if tree were standing) of collection, and various data about physical aspects of the sample. Data evaluated from the prepared, crossdated tree-ring samples includes: dates of centers, various data about \"growth-changes\" (abrupt and sustained changes in ringwidths), data relevant to Douglas-fir crown development, radial growth measurements, and data relevant to height- growth of Douglas-fir in the study stand. Note that some data may be repeated in multiple entities, for purposes of linking together data from different entities, and for purposes of the original study for which the database was developed." ;

Intensive study sites are located in the Skookum Experimental Watersheds (Heppner Ranger District) and a more extensive array of hillslope erosion plots are located in the Red Fir Prescribed Burn Project, the Lick Creek Demonstration Site (both on Pomeroy Ranger District) and in the Lane Creek Prescribed Burn Project (North Fork John Day Ranger District).  The Skookum Experimental Watersheds were set up in 1992 on the headwaters of Skookum Creek.  The original objective was to address streamflow and sediment responses to timber harvest.  The focus shifted to responses to prescribed fire in the mid 1990’s.  The Skookum Experimental Watersheds consist of two paired watersheds, a control watershed (300 hectares) and a proposed treatment watershed (500 hectares).  Prescribed burning has not taken place in the proposed treatment watershed, and data records represent background conditions." ;

Stream temperature sensors were placed at multiple sites at matched elevations in the main headwater streams of Lookout Creek, Mack Creek and McRae Creek as well as above and below major confluences in downstream reaches. Air temperatures were recorded 1.5 m above the stream at selected sites. Data were collected every half hour during late spring and summers. Some sites have data during fall and winter, but multiple sensors were lost over winter. For periods of time, sensors were also placed in bottom of shallow piezometric wells in WS 3." ;

                strategies are good indicators of an array of features pertaining to habitat
                quality. Responses to changes in quality take place quickly due to the short life
                spans and specialized requirements of many species. Second, arthropods provide a key

                what is going on with vertebrate populations (many birds and lizards eat insects),

    glview:description """The first Phoenix Area Social Survey (PASS) was conducted as a pilot study in 2001.
            Our main objective was to examine the reciprocal relationships, or the interplay,
            between the social and natural environments in an urban ecosystem. In order to begin to
            understand this complex process, social scientists affiliated with the Central
            Arizona-Phoenix LTER conducted a pilot survey of 302 residents in 8 neighborhoods in the
            city of Phoenix. Our central research questions asked how neighborhood social ties,
            values, and behaviors are connected with one another in ways that reflect willingness to
            act socially and politically with respect to the environment, and how changing
            environmental conditions, in turn, affect the quality of human life. The survey measured
            the social ties of individuals to their communities, values and sentiments regarding
            communities, behaviors that affect the natural environment, and satisfaction with the
            quality of life in the area. The second wave of PASS was conducted in 2006 with an
            expanded sample size in 40 neighborhoods across the metropolitan region. Many of the
            questions about community were repeated from the pilot study and the new survey added
            items for perceptions, values, and behavior concerning water supply and conservation;
            land use, preservation and growth management; air quality and transportation; and
            climate change and the urban heat island.""" ;

A) 37 old fields of various ages were surveyed for above and below ground biomass, soil N, and light penetration. Five strips (1m x 10cm) were clipped in each field for above ground biomass (sorted to grasses and forbs; then sorted to leaf and stem), and 3 root cores (down to 30cm) taken per strip (rinsed, dried and weighed). Two light measurements and one pooled (3 cores) soil N sample (for available and total N) were taken per strip. 
 
B) 35 abundant species of known successional status were harvested from the field (usually 15 individuals per species), including roots contained in a core 20x30cm, dried, sorted to stem, leaf, and root, and weighed. These data can be combined with the old field survey results (E014) to estimate successional trends in allocation. 
 
C) Root cores will be taken from microplots in fields A, B, C, and D, all treatments. This will be an estimate of root biomass to be combined with the above ground samples (E001) to assess root-shoot trends in response to manipulation of soil N in fields of different age.""" ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description "The purpose of this observational study is to describe the dynamics of ecosystem succession. The change in the number, type, and amount of plant and grazing animal species is monitored in more than 20 fields. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields. Abandoned fields included in E014 are 4, 5, 10, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 47, 53, 70, 72, 76, 77. Fields 22(B), 29(A), and 69(C) were originally included in E014 but used for other purposes shortly after the start of the study. This experiment was established in 1983 and 1989 by principal investigators Johannes Knops and David Tilman." ;

There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description "The influence of inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs on decomposition is poorly understood.  Some prior studies suggest that N may reduce the decomposition of substrates with high concentrations of lignin via inhibitory effects on the activity of lignin-degrading enzymes, although such inhibition has not always been demonstrated.  The purpose of E145 was to study the effects of nitrogen (N) addition on decomposition of seven substrates ranging in initial lignin concentrations (from 7.4 - 25.6%) over five years in eight different grassland and forest sites in central Minnesota." ;

    glview:description """Modern agriculture and fossil fuel combustion contribute to the transfer of N from largely inert pools (atmospheric N2, fossil fuel reserves) to biologically reactive forms that can be transported downwind from agricultural or industrial areas to ecosystems that historically may have experienced low levels of N inputs. Understanding how increased N inputs alter the cycling of another biologically important element, C, has been impeded by uncertainties about N effects on the process of decomposition. To date, ecologists remain unable to predict when, where, and in what forms N addition stimulates rates of decomposition. For example, recent work showed that in eight low-N sites in Central Minnesota, litter N was positively correlated with decomposition, suggesting N limitation of decomposition, yet addition of inorganic N fertilizer increased decomposition in only two of eight sites. These paradoxical results call into question the assumption that the often-observed correlation between substrate N concentration and decomposition arises because N limits decomposition. Research is addressing three interrelated questions:* (1) Why do litter N and externally supplied N have contrasting effects on decomposition in low-N ecosystems? (2) Do different forms of N (organic vs. inorganic; substrate vs. externally supplied) affect the activity, function and composition of the decomposer community differently, and, if so, what are the consequences for decomposition? (3) What are temporal dynamics of the activity, function, and composition of the decomposer community and do these dynamics depend upon the amount and forms of N supplied to the decomposer community?* These questions will be addressed using a 4-y decomposition experiment manipulating the quantity and form of N available to decomposers via use of substrates ranging in N concentrations and of inorganic (ammonium nitrate) and organic (amino acids) N fertilizers. The response of microbial biomass, stoichiometry, efficiency, function (decomposition rate, enzyme activity) and community structure (assessed using phospholipids fatty acid analysis) are being compared among treatments. The proposed research will increase understanding of how atmospheric N deposition alters C cycling in ecosystems.

For example, recent work showed that in eight low-N sites in Central Minnesota, litter N was positively correlated with decomposition, suggesting N limitation of decomposition, yet addition of inorganic N fertilizer increased decomposition in only two of eight sites. These paradoxical results call into question the assumption that the often-observed correlation between substrate N concentration and decomposition arises because N limits decomposition. Research is addressing three interrelated questions:* (1) Why do litter N and externally supplied N have contrasting effects on decomposition in low-N ecosystems? (2) Do different forms of N (organic vs. inorganic; substrate vs. externally supplied) affect the activity, function and composition of the decomposer community differently, and, if so, what are the consequences for decomposition? (3) What are temporal dynamics of the activity, function, and composition of the decomposer community and do these dynamics depend upon the amount and forms of N supplied to the decomposer community?* These questions will be addressed using a 4-y decomposition experiment manipulating the quantity and form of N available to decomposers via use of substrates ranging in N concentrations and of inorganic (ammonium nitrate) and organic (amino acids) N fertilizers. The response of microbial biomass, stoichiometry, efficiency, function (decomposition rate, enzyme activity) and community structure (assessed using phospholipids fatty acid analysis) are being compared among treatments. The proposed research will increase understanding of how atmospheric N deposition alters C cycling in ecosystems.

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied. Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species. The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin. Experiment 120 is similar to Experiment 123, but it uses larger plots to provide a large capacity for long-term subexperiments." ;

The basis for the study is an ongoing, experimental prescribed burning program begun in 1964 at Cedar Creek, and a similar program operating since 1962 on the adjacent Helen Allison Savanna property (owned by The Nature Conservancy). These prescribed burning programs are designed to subject upland oak communities (and some old fields) to different burn frequencies and patterns of burning, with the ultimate objectives of 1) restoring and maintaining the historically important savanna and open woodland vegetation, and 2) providing information about the effects of different burning patterns on vegetation structure and composition. This study addresses the latter of these two purposes and expands on it by also investigating possible influences of fire on resource availability (nutrients, water, and light) and net primary productivity. This study represents a continuation and expansion of experiments 015 and 094." ;

The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields.

    glview:description "Biodiversity II (E120) is designed to determine how the number of plant species affects the dynamics of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied. Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species. The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin. Experiment 120 is similar to Experiment 123, but it uses larger plots to provide a large capacity for long-term subexperiments." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment." ;

The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields.

One plot in each pair was randomly assigned to exclude birds (BEX) and the other to allow birds to forage for grasshoppers in the vegetation (BAL). A frame was built around BEX plots with wooden posts at each corner and heavy aluminum wire stretched between posts 1m above the ground. Bird netting (2.5 cm mesh) was then stretched over this framework and attached to the ground with numerous wire stakes. In 1989, these plots were set up 15 July, but were set up 15 May in 1990 to examine the effects of predation in the early summer. Between 15-25 August, netting was removed and grasshoppers were sampled within both BEX and BAL plots and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification to species or genus, counting and weighing. Grasshoppers were sampled by two people with butterfly nets. After the grasshoppers were sampled, the vegetation was sampled. Within each 9 m x 9 m plot, three 0.1 m x 3 m strips were clipped, sorted to species, dried and weighed.

    glview:description "This experiment is designed to examine the mechanisms of competition among grasshoppers, effects of grasshoppers on plant competition, and the effects of plant species and biomass on the ability of grasshoppers to coexist. The plots were set up within the E026 fenced exclosure. The plots are 60cm x 60cm. They are enclosed by a cage which is 1.2m high. The 240 plots were seeded with monocultures and pairwise combinations of two grasses, Schizachyrium scoparium, Poa pratensis, and a legume Lespedeza capitata. To each plant monoculture and species combination, two grasshopper species were added at high density according to four treatments: each grasshopper species by itself (2 treatments), both species together, and no grasshoppers (empty cage). Introduced grasshoppers were allowed to decline to an \"equilibrium\" density, as determined by counting all grasshoppers in cages every 5 days. After grasshoppers reached \"equilibrium\", vegetation was sampled by clipping a 50cm x 5cm strip. Soil samples were taken 5 times during the summer to determine the effect of grasshoppers on available soil nitrogen. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte71." ;

The basis for the study is an ongoing, experimental prescribed burning program begun in 1964 at Cedar Creek, and a similar program operating since 1962 on the adjacent Helen Allison Savanna property (owned by The Nature Conservancy). These prescribed burning programs are designed to subject upland oak communities (and some old fields) to different burn frequencies and patterns of burning, with the ultimate objectives of 1) restoring and maintaining the historically important savanna and open woodland vegetation, and 2) providing information about the effects of different burning patterns on vegetation structure and composition. This study addresses the latter of these two purposes and expands on it by also investigating possible influences of fire on resource availability (nutrients, water, and light) and net primary productivity. This study represents a continuation and expansion of experiments 015 and 094." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

The change in the number, type, and amount of plant and grazing animal species is monitored in more than 20 fields. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields. Abandoned fields included in E014 are 4, 5, 10, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 47, 53, 70, 72, 76, 77.

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants.

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot.

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year, that result can be examined. Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied. Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species. The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin. Experiment 120 is similar to Experiment 123, but it uses larger plots to provide a large capacity for long-term subexperiments." ;

This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients.

The change in the number, type, and amount of plant and grazing animal species is monitored in more than 20 fields.

The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields.

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants. Seedlings were transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.""" ;

For a list of fertilizer treatments for each plot, see file trmte11 and fertilization details. The object of this research was to measure the intensity of above and below-ground competition along a gradient of soil resource availability. Neighbor effects were quantified by measuring the biomass, growth, morphology and survivorship of three species transplanted into vegetation along a gradient of soil nitrogen availability. Transplants were used to test for an inverse relationship between above and below-ground competition, variation in the intensity of competition at different levels of nutrient availability, and reversal of competitive hierarchies. Eight plots of each nitrogen treatment were randomly selected and used for competition experiments. Three competition treatments were used to measure the above and below-ground effects of neighbors on transplanted seedlings at each rate of nitrogen supply. Transplants were grown in subplots with no neighbors, or in subplots with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, or in subplots with all above- and below-ground parts of neighbors present. No neighbor treatments were imposed by driving a ring of galvanized sheet steel (50cm in diameter, 15cm tall) into the ground until the top of it was at the soil surface and then killing all the plants in the enclosed circle with a systemic, rapidly decomposing herbicide (Roundup). Transplants were grown with only the roots of neighbors using white plastic garden net (50x50cm; mesh:1x2cm) to tie back the shoots and leaves of neighbors so that a transplant in the center of the net was not shaded by neighbors but was surrounded by neighbor roots. The all neighbors treatment consisted of a transplant grown in the center of a 50cm x 50cm subplot of undisturbed vegetation. Treatments were replicated five times for each of three transplanted species in each of the 8 replicate plots for each of the three levels of the experimental nitrogen gradient. Thus, the 24 plots of the nitrogen gradient (3 nitrogen levels x 8 replicates used in the competition experiment) each contained 45 subplots(3 competition treatments x 3 transplanted species x 5 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant of a single species in one competition treatment. A total of 1080 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments and species were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. Transplants were of three grass species, Schizachyrium scoparium, Poa pratensis and Agropyron repens, selected for their different distributions along the experimental nitrogen gradient. One transplant was planted in the center of each subplot." ;

    glview:description """This is the new garden plot experiment located next to the E026 gardens. This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070). The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger. The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added. Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%. The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations. 
 
Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \\& K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June. For further information, see fertilization details. Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots. Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70. 
 
Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture. Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen. At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals. 
 
The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species: Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC). Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989. The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place. 
 
A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area. The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource. Light readings were taken above and below vegetation. Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken. A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.""" ;

The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species. The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin. Experiment 120 is similar to Experiment 123, but it uses larger plots to provide a large capacity for long-term subexperiments." ;

    glview:description "Biodiversity I (E123), also called the \"small biodiversity experiment,\" was designed to determine how the number of species affects the dynamics of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year that result can be examined. Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied. The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species. The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures. The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops. Experiment 123 is similar to Experiment 120, but it uses smaller plots and did not categorize by type of plant species prior to randomizing species to plots. This size of plot in Experiment 123 means that the soils are relatively more homogeneous and the desired number of species can be more easily maintained by frequent hand weeding than with larger plots. However, the small size of plots limits sampling and the nesting of other studies within the plots." ;

This experiment is being conducted in field B, outside the fenced area of the microplots. Each experimental unit consists of a circular plot of 3 meters diameter, at the center of which there is a Schizachyrium scoparium plant. Two treatments are being tested: 
 
1 (=A). All the vegetation around the central S. scoparium was killed with roundup at a rate of 2.04 g/m2 (1g of Isopropylamine salt of N (phosphonomethyl ) Glycine ). Spraying was repeated at the same rate as needed (Yearly folder). A plastic barrier, 80 cm high, was placed around each Schizachyrium scoparium plant to protect it from any drift that might occur. The area sprayed is the circle with 2 m radius around the central plant. 
 
2 (=B). The vegetation around S. scoparium is left intact. Each treatment is replicated 5 times. The two treatments were randomly assigned to the 10 plots of the experiment. 
 
The plot layout is: 
 
Plot # 	Treatment 
1	2 
2	1 
3	2 
4	2 
5	1 
6	1 
7	1 
8	2 
9	2 
10	1 
 
Soil samples were taken several times and the amount of ammonium and nitrate were determined at the lab. Soil samples were also taken once for mineralization rate, microbial biomass and total carbon determination.

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

We established a factorial experiment that manipulates N (0 or 3 g m-2 yr-1), fire (none or every 2nd year), and deer (fenced or open to deer), with a total of 32 plots, each 20 x 20 m. We hypothesized that the response of this ecosystem to the combined effects of fire, N, and herbivory would depend on the ability of pine and other species to invade and the magnitude of their response to the different disturbance factors: warm-season grasses increase with and encourage fire, resist herbivores, and inhibit woody plant invasion (Davis et al. 1998, Inouye et al. 1994); cool-season plants are favored by N deposition (Tilman 1987) but are fire-intolerant and palatable to herbivores; legumes tolerate fire but decrease with herbivory and N deposition; and finally, woody plants are fire-intolerant and may be more susceptible to herbivory. We are measuring treatment effects on composition and diversity of plants and consumers (insects, small mammals, lizards) as well as plant and soil C and N." ;

The change in the number, type, and amount of plant and grazing animal species is monitored in more than 20 fields. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields. Abandoned fields included in E014 are 4, 5, 10, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 47, 53, 70, 72, 76, 77.

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants. Seedlings were transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.""" ;

Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied. Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level.

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied. The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species. The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures. The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops. Experiment 123 is similar to Experiment 120, but it uses smaller plots and did not categorize by type of plant species prior to randomizing species to plots. This size of plot in Experiment 123 means that the soils are relatively more homogeneous and the desired number of species can be more easily maintained by frequent hand weeding than with larger plots. However, the small size of plots limits sampling and the nesting of other studies within the plots." ;

We established a factorial experiment that manipulates N (0 or 3 g m-2 yr-1), fire (none or every 2nd year), and deer (fenced or open to deer), with a total of 32 plots, each 20 x 20 m. We hypothesized that the response of this ecosystem to the combined effects of fire, N, and herbivory would depend on the ability of pine and other species to invade and the magnitude of their response to the different disturbance factors: warm-season grasses increase with and encourage fire, resist herbivores, and inhibit woody plant invasion (Davis et al. 1998, Inouye et al. 1994); cool-season plants are favored by N deposition (Tilman 1987) but are fire-intolerant and palatable to herbivores; legumes tolerate fire but decrease with herbivory and N deposition; and finally, woody plants are fire-intolerant and may be more susceptible to herbivory. We are measuring treatment effects on composition and diversity of plants and consumers (insects, small mammals, lizards) as well as plant and soil C and N." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description "The purpose of this experiment is to measure how initially disturbing an area and adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment." ;

By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year that result can be examined. Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied. The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species. The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures. The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops. Experiment 123 is similar to Experiment 120, but it uses smaller plots and did not categorize by type of plant species prior to randomizing species to plots. This size of plot in Experiment 123 means that the soils are relatively more homogeneous and the desired number of species can be more easily maintained by frequent hand weeding than with larger plots.

    glview:description "The purpose of this experiment is to measure how initially disturbing an area and adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment." ;

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants. Seedlings were transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.""" ;

    glview:description """This is the new garden plot experiment located next to the E026 gardens. This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070). The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger. The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added. Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%. The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations. 
 
Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \\& K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June. For further information, see fertilization details. Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots. Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70. 
 
Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture. Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen. At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals. 
 
The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species: Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC). Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989. The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place. 
 
A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area. The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource. Light readings were taken above and below vegetation. Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken. A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.""" ;

A frame was built around BEX plots with wooden posts at each corner and heavy aluminum wire stretched between posts 1m above the ground. Bird netting (2.5 cm mesh) was then stretched over this framework and attached to the ground with numerous wire stakes. In 1989, these plots were set up 15 July, but were set up 15 May in 1990 to examine the effects of predation in the early summer. Between 15-25 August, netting was removed and grasshoppers were sampled within both BEX and BAL plots and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification to species or genus, counting and weighing. Grasshoppers were sampled by two people with butterfly nets. After the grasshoppers were sampled, the vegetation was sampled. Within each 9 m x 9 m plot, three 0.1 m x 3 m strips were clipped, sorted to species, dried and weighed.

    glview:description """This experiment was established in November of 1990. It involved placing over a thousand preweighed and labeled oak and birch dowels in the field across the Cedar Creek landscape. The purpose is to measure the decomposition potential using a uniform common substrate across Cedar Creeks broad range of ecosystems. 
 
Each of the 27 sites have 11 above and 11 belowground dowels of birch and the same number of red oak. This allows for two samples the first year and one per year thereafter for 10 years. Each dowel is 12.7cm long and 1.27cm in diameter. Each dowel is preweighed and tagged. Belowground dowels are driven into the ground vertically and tethered to two pieces of rebar (birch on one, oak on the other) located about a meter apart. Aboveground dowels are laid on top of existing litter and are tethered to the rebars. Resin bags are tethered to the rebars and buried in the upper soil (ca. 5cm). 
 
Replicate sets of dowels and ion exchange resin bags (to measure N availability) were placed in 9 grassland, 9 forest, and 9 wetland sites. All 27 sites are in or adjacent to already established LTER plots. The first samples were collected in May 1991.

Three transects in sedge and graminoid dominated wetlands were established, with plots beginning in an upland prairie vegetation zone and ending in the center of the wetland. Within each vegetation zone and at each of the transitions between these zones, a core of soil or peat was collected. Cores were approximately 60-90cm in length, and in most cases, penetrated the mineral soil. The core was cut into 5-10cm sections or was cut at distinct changes in soil color or texture. The samples were tested for total C and N with a Carlo Erba analyzer. An additional set of cores, 20cm in length, were collected for separation and analysis of root biomass. In a 1 m2 plot at each of the core sites, the vegetation was described by estimating percent cover of each species. Above ground biomass was then collected along the transect in the middle of vegetation zones (but not at the transitions). Three randomly selected 1 m2 plots per zone were cleared of standing biomass and litter. The vegetation was dried and weighed, and a subsample from each plots litter was collected for analysis. Total C and N were measured on the Carlo Erba analyzer. Additional transects will be established during the summer of 1992 to include a wider range of wetland types." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity.

Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen?

While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are:

1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development.

2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments.

3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers.

While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description "Biodiversity I (E123), also called the \"small biodiversity experiment,\" was designed to determine how the number of species affects the dynamics of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year that result can be examined. Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied. The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species. The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures. The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops. Experiment 123 is similar to Experiment 120, but it uses smaller plots and did not categorize by type of plant species prior to randomizing species to plots. This size of plot in Experiment 123 means that the soils are relatively more homogeneous and the desired number of species can be more easily maintained by frequent hand weeding than with larger plots. However, the small size of plots limits sampling and the nesting of other studies within the plots." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants. Seedlings were transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.""" ;

This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070). The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger. The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added. Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%. The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations. 
 
Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \\& K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June. For further information, see fertilization details. Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots. Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70. 
 
Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture. Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen. At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals. 
 
The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species: Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC). Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989. The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place. 
 
A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area. The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource. Light readings were taken above and below vegetation. Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken. A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.""" ;

Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied. The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species. The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs.

Experiment 123 is similar to Experiment 120, but it uses smaller plots and did not categorize by type of plant species prior to randomizing species to plots. This size of plot in Experiment 123 means that the soils are relatively more homogeneous and the desired number of species can be more easily maintained by frequent hand weeding than with larger plots.

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

We established a factorial experiment that manipulates N (0 or 3 g m-2 yr-1), fire (none or every 2nd year), and deer (fenced or open to deer), with a total of 32 plots, each 20 x 20 m. We hypothesized that the response of this ecosystem to the combined effects of fire, N, and herbivory would depend on the ability of pine and other species to invade and the magnitude of their response to the different disturbance factors: warm-season grasses increase with and encourage fire, resist herbivores, and inhibit woody plant invasion (Davis et al. 1998, Inouye et al. 1994); cool-season plants are favored by N deposition (Tilman 1987) but are fire-intolerant and palatable to herbivores; legumes tolerate fire but decrease with herbivory and N deposition; and finally, woody plants are fire-intolerant and may be more susceptible to herbivory. We are measuring treatment effects on composition and diversity of plants and consumers (insects, small mammals, lizards) as well as plant and soil C and N." ;

The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned.

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants. Seedlings were transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.""" ;

    glview:description "This study examines the effects of long-term prescribed burning treatments on vegetation structure and composition, productivity, and nutrient cycling in upland oak savanna and woodland vegetation. The basis for the study is an ongoing, experimental prescribed burning program begun in 1964 at Cedar Creek, and a similar program operating since 1962 on the adjacent Helen Allison Savanna property (owned by The Nature Conservancy). These prescribed burning programs are designed to subject upland oak communities (and some old fields) to different burn frequencies and patterns of burning, with the ultimate objectives of 1) restoring and maintaining the historically important savanna and open woodland vegetation, and 2) providing information about the effects of different burning patterns on vegetation structure and composition. This study addresses the latter of these two purposes and expands on it by also investigating possible influences of fire on resource availability (nutrients, water, and light) and net primary productivity. This study represents a continuation and expansion of experiments 015 and 094." ;

This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned.

Five strips (1m x 10cm) were clipped in each field for above ground biomass (sorted to grasses and forbs; then sorted to leaf and stem), and 3 root cores (down to 30cm) taken per strip (rinsed, dried and weighed). Two light measurements and one pooled (3 cores) soil N sample (for available and total N) were taken per strip. 
 
B) 35 abundant species of known successional status were harvested from the field (usually 15 individuals per species), including roots contained in a core 20x30cm, dried, sorted to stem, leaf, and root, and weighed. These data can be combined with the old field survey results (E014) to estimate successional trends in allocation.

For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants.

    glview:description """This is the new garden plot experiment located next to the E026 gardens. This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070). The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger. The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added. Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%. The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations. 
 
Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \\& K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June. For further information, see fertilization details. Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots. Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70. 
 
Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture. Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen. At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals. 
 
The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species: Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC). Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989. The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place. 
 
A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area. The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource. Light readings were taken above and below vegetation. Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken. A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.""" ;

One plot in each pair was randomly assigned to exclude birds (BEX) and the other to allow birds to forage for grasshoppers in the vegetation (BAL). A frame was built around BEX plots with wooden posts at each corner and heavy aluminum wire stretched between posts 1m above the ground. Bird netting (2.5 cm mesh) was then stretched over this framework and attached to the ground with numerous wire stakes. In 1989, these plots were set up 15 July, but were set up 15 May in 1990 to examine the effects of predation in the early summer. Between 15-25 August, netting was removed and grasshoppers were sampled within both BEX and BAL plots and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification to species or genus, counting and weighing. Grasshoppers were sampled by two people with butterfly nets. After the grasshoppers were sampled, the vegetation was sampled. Within each 9 m x 9 m plot, three 0.1 m x 3 m strips were clipped, sorted to species, dried and weighed.

To each plant monoculture and species combination, two grasshopper species were added at high density according to four treatments: each grasshopper species by itself (2 treatments), both species together, and no grasshoppers (empty cage). Introduced grasshoppers were allowed to decline to an \"equilibrium\" density, as determined by counting all grasshoppers in cages every 5 days.

The basis for the study is an ongoing, experimental prescribed burning program begun in 1964 at Cedar Creek, and a similar program operating since 1962 on the adjacent Helen Allison Savanna property (owned by The Nature Conservancy). These prescribed burning programs are designed to subject upland oak communities (and some old fields) to different burn frequencies and patterns of burning, with the ultimate objectives of 1) restoring and maintaining the historically important savanna and open woodland vegetation, and 2) providing information about the effects of different burning patterns on vegetation structure and composition. This study addresses the latter of these two purposes and expands on it by also investigating possible influences of fire on resource availability (nutrients, water, and light) and net primary productivity. This study represents a continuation and expansion of experiments 015 and 094." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

We hypothesized that the response of this ecosystem to the combined effects of fire, N, and herbivory would depend on the ability of pine and other species to invade and the magnitude of their response to the different disturbance factors: warm-season grasses increase with and encourage fire, resist herbivores, and inhibit woody plant invasion (Davis et al. 1998, Inouye et al. 1994); cool-season plants are favored by N deposition (Tilman 1987) but are fire-intolerant and palatable to herbivores; legumes tolerate fire but decrease with herbivory and N deposition; and finally, woody plants are fire-intolerant and may be more susceptible to herbivory. We are measuring treatment effects on composition and diversity of plants and consumers (insects, small mammals, lizards) as well as plant and soil C and N." ;

This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients.

The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned.

A) 37 old fields of various ages were surveyed for above and below ground biomass, soil N, and light penetration. Five strips (1m x 10cm) were clipped in each field for above ground biomass (sorted to grasses and forbs; then sorted to leaf and stem), and 3 root cores (down to 30cm) taken per strip (rinsed, dried and weighed). Two light measurements and one pooled (3 cores) soil N sample (for available and total N) were taken per strip. 
 
B) 35 abundant species of known successional status were harvested from the field (usually 15 individuals per species), including roots contained in a core 20x30cm, dried, sorted to stem, leaf, and root, and weighed. These data can be combined with the old field survey results (E014) to estimate successional trends in allocation. 
 
C) Root cores will be taken from microplots in fields A, B, C, and D, all treatments. This will be an estimate of root biomass to be combined with the above ground samples (E001) to assess root-shoot trends in response to manipulation of soil N in fields of different age.""" ;

Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr.

This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070). The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger. The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added. Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%. The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations. 
 
Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \\& K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June. For further information, see fertilization details. Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots. Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70. 
 
Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture. Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen. At the time the seeds were planted, each plot was fertilized with a mixture of P, K, Ca, Mg and trace metals. 
 
The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species: Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC). Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989. The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place. 
 
A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area. The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource. Light readings were taken above and below vegetation. Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken. A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.""" ;

Plots are large (9m x 9m actively maintained) and well-replicated, allowing responses of plant pathogens, insect herbivores, seed predators, soil parameters, invasive plant species and other variables to also be studied. Plots were seeded in May 1994 to have 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 species, with roughly 30 replicates of each diversity level. The species composition of each plot was chosen by random draw from a pool of 18 grassland perennials that included four warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, four non-legume forbs, and two woody species. All species occur in monoculture allowing comparison of responses of each species in monoculture to combinations of these same species. The experiment was established in 1994 by the lead investigators David Tilman, Peter Reich, Johannes Knops, and David Wedin.

The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species. The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs.

Experiment 123 is similar to Experiment 120, but it uses smaller plots and did not categorize by type of plant species prior to randomizing species to plots. This size of plot in Experiment 123 means that the soils are relatively more homogeneous and the desired number of species can be more easily maintained by frequent hand weeding than with larger plots.

The basis for the study is an ongoing, experimental prescribed burning program begun in 1964 at Cedar Creek, and a similar program operating since 1962 on the adjacent Helen Allison Savanna property (owned by The Nature Conservancy). These prescribed burning programs are designed to subject upland oak communities (and some old fields) to different burn frequencies and patterns of burning, with the ultimate objectives of 1) restoring and maintaining the historically important savanna and open woodland vegetation, and 2) providing information about the effects of different burning patterns on vegetation structure and composition. This study addresses the latter of these two purposes and expands on it by also investigating possible influences of fire on resource availability (nutrients, water, and light) and net primary productivity.

The plots were planted with different combinations of the following species: Schizachyrium scoparium (SS), Andropogon gerardi (AG), Bouteloua gracilis (BG), Panicum virgatum (PV), Agropyron smithii (AS), Buchloe dactyloides (BD) and Solidago canadensis (SC). Seeds were planted on May 23-25, 1989. The Solidago canadensis did not germinate, so Quercus ellipsoidalis (QR) seeds were planted in its place. 
 
A below-ground gopher fence (3 feet deep and 1 foot wide) and an above-ground rodent/deer fence (6 feet tall) was built around the area. The plots are watered throughout the growing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource. Light readings were taken above and below vegetation. Soil samples for ammonium and nitrate and belowground biomass are periodically taken. A sample of aboveground biomass are clipped, sorted and weighed periodically.""" ;

    glview:description "The purpose of this experiment is to measure how initially disturbing an area and adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description """This is the new garden plot experiment located next to the E026 gardens. This garden contains monocultures of major grass species from across the grassland biome of North America, and also 3 legume species (E070). The design and purpose are similar to E026, except the plots are larger. The basic experimental design consists of growing plants in monoculture and in various competitive combinations on each of 14 different soil mixtures. A bulldozer was used to remove 30 inches of top soil at the site. To each plot a certain amount of black dirt, ranging from 0.3 inches to 10 inches, was added. Total carbon ranged from 0.1928% to 5.63134% and total nitrogen ranged from 0.0158% to 0.4591%. The exact amounts of black soil added to each plot are described in the field operations. 
 
Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 \\& K2O are added to the plots each year in early May and late June. For further information, see fertilization details. Each soil mixture has 26 sub-plots. Subplots 24, 25 and 26 are now part of experiment 70. 
 
Each subplot, which is 1.2 m x 1.2 m, is a unique treatment. Thus, there are no replicates of a treatment within a soil mixture. Rather, the experiment is a regression experiment, with the regression variable being the experimentally-imposed level of total soil nitrogen.

We hypothesized that the response of this ecosystem to the combined effects of fire, N, and herbivory would depend on the ability of pine and other species to invade and the magnitude of their response to the different disturbance factors: warm-season grasses increase with and encourage fire, resist herbivores, and inhibit woody plant invasion (Davis et al. 1998, Inouye et al. 1994); cool-season plants are favored by N deposition (Tilman 1987) but are fire-intolerant and palatable to herbivores; legumes tolerate fire but decrease with herbivory and N deposition; and finally, woody plants are fire-intolerant and may be more susceptible to herbivory.

Five strips (1m x 10cm) were clipped in each field for above ground biomass (sorted to grasses and forbs; then sorted to leaf and stem), and 3 root cores (down to 30cm) taken per strip (rinsed, dried and weighed). Two light measurements and one pooled (3 cores) soil N sample (for available and total N) were taken per strip.

    glview:description """There are four levels of nitrogen, corresponding to treatments A, C, E and G in E001, applied at the same time as in that experiment. For a description of fertilizer added to E052, see file fertilization details. There are four levels of soil disturbance designated 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Level 1: undisturbed 
Level 2: 1 pass with a 7 HP Honda rear-tined rototiller with the elevator set to till to a depth of 9 inches 
Level 3: 2 passes or however many required to produce about 50% bare ground 
Level 4: 3 passes or however many required to produce 100% bare ground. This requires 3 passes in some plots but 5 or 6 in others. In addition, all woody vegetation not destroyed by tilling is cut at the base. 
 
Rototilling is applied in late April. 
 
Each fertilization treatment receives each disturbance treatment, for a total of sixteen treatments. There are four replicates of each of the sixteen treatments. In addition, the four extreme ends (lowest N, lowest disturbance; highest N, lowest disturbance, etc. ) are replicated an additional ten times. Treatments are applied in a completely randomized design. Each of the 104 plots is 5m x 5m. 
 
Measurements taken at E052 will include: 1) species abundances, 2) community biomass allocation to leaves/roots/stems/flowers, 3) above and below ground net primary production and 4) rates of nitrogen mineralization. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte52. 
 
The plots in E052 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 50cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground and poultry netting extends to 2m above the ground. 
 
In 1990, ten plots of each of four treatments (N1D1, N1D4, N4D1, N4D4, where N is the level of nitrogen added and D is the disturbance treatment) were randomly selected for the competition experiment. The above and belowground effects of neighbors on transplanted grass seedlings were measured using three competition treatments: transplants were grown in 50cm diameter subplots 1) with no neighbors, 2) with the roots but not shoots of neighbors, 3) with all above and belowground parts of neighbors present. One transplant was grown in the center of each subplot. Competition treatments were applied to subplots within the main plots during 14-18 May, 1990. Competition treatments were replicated three times in each of the ten replicate plots for each of the four combinations of nitrogen supply rate and disturbance. Thus, the 40 plots of the nitrogen and disturbance combinations (2 nitrogen levels x 2 disturbance levels x 10 replicates) each contained 9 subplots (3 competition treatments x 3 replicates), each subplot comprising one transplant in one competition treatment. A total of 360 seedlings were transplanted. Competition treatments were assigned randomly to subplots within each plot. 
 
In 1991, three species of contrasting sizes, life histories, growth rates and positions along gradients of nitrogen and disturbance in the experiment were used: Schizachyrium scoparium, Agropyron repens, and Setaria viridis. Transplants were grown individually in subplots, with 1) all neighbors and 2) no neighbors. The experiment was conducted in high and low nutrient environments to test for the interaction between the environment, the size and the species. There were ten replicate plots of each of the two environments, one receiving no additional nitrogen and the second receiving nitrogen at 17g/m2/yr. In total, there were 32 transplants (3 species x 3 size classes x 2 competition treatments x 1, 2 or 3 replicates) in each plot, and 20 plots (2 environments x 10 replicates), or 640 transplants. Seedlings were transplanted into the field during 3-6 June, 1991.""" ;

    glview:description """This experiment was set up in field \"B\" on August 23, 1990, within the mammalian herbivore exclosure fence (see E001). This experiment consists of 8 treatments with 6 replicates of each. The 48 plots were randomly assigned their treatment. Plot size is 1m x 1m. Each plot is divided into 4 equal portions. Three of these portions were labeled subplots 5, 6 and 7. The other portion was subdivided into 4 additional portions. The latter subplots were labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, each main plot has 7 subplots of which 3 are 0.5m x 0.5m in size and 4 are 0.25m x 0.25m in size. Seeds of many species were collected from Cedar Creek Natural History Area in the fall of 1990 and some were purchased. These seeds were added in the spring of 1991 to the plots according to the following treatments: 
 
1: Control 
2: Lightly raked in spring 
3: Seed of 29 species added 
4: Seed of 29 species + raked 
5: Seed of 29 species + Schizachyrium seed (8000/m2) 
6: Seed of 29 species + Schizachyrium seed (8000/m2) + raked 
7: Seed of Schizachyrium (8000/m2) + raked 
8: Seedlings of Schizachyrium (144/m2) 
 
Percent cover estimates were done in the fall of 1990 to get baseline data of the species present in the plots before adding seeds. For a list of treatments and the amount of seeds of each species added, see the treatment layouts in file trmte85.""" ;

The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields.

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description """Metapopulation theory posits that suitable habitat may recently be

unoccupied because it is isolated and has never been colonized or has been

been colonized followed by local extinction and has not yet been

recolonized. This research addresses the question of how to identify

suitable, unoccupied habitat and distinguish it from unsuitable habitat. We

are studying a group of six species of forest understory herbs chosen to

represent a broad range of habitat distribution and dispersal

characteristics. Our aim is to quantify the fundamental niche of these

species (sensu Hutchinson 1957), in terms of variables such as soil

moisture and temperature, by developing a set of habitat specific

demographic stage transition models (i.e. conditional on such environmental

variables) for these species. These models, in combination with data from

field surveys of the local distribution of the species, will be used to

develop testable predictive maps of the distribution of suitable habitat

which can be compared to the observed distribution of the plants. We

hypothesize that both dispersal ability and the distribution of suitable

habitat are important determinants of the actual distribution of species.

The goal of this research is both to further our conceptual understanding of

the relationships between habitat requirements and species distributions,

and to provide a practical approach to operationalizing the concept of

\"suitable habitat.\" In order to quantify the niche requirements of our study species, we are simultaneously tracking their year-to-year demography and the environmental conditions to which they are subject. Environmental variables of interest 

include soil moisture, soil temperature, light levels, and soil chemistry.

Soil moisture will be measured biweekly during the growing season and

approximately monthly during the winters to depths of 10 and 30cm at four

locations within each study plot, using Coweetas Tektronix TDR unit. Soil

temperature will be monitored contimually using a Hobo data logger. Soil

chemistry variables we anticipate measuring include pH, N, and C. Subcanopy

light levels will be derived using hemispherical photography. The study

plots are subdivided into grids of 2x2m cells, marked with orange stake

flags. Within these all ramets of our study species are marked with stake

flags of various colors and given unique identifying numbers so that their

growth and survival can be foloowed from year to year. Variables of interest

include plant size or leaf area, flower and fruit production, and

recruitment of new ramets. This information, along with the measures of

local environmental conditions within study plots, will be used to construct

condition-specific demographic stage transition models, providing a

meaningful quantitative definition of habitat suitability for our six study

species.""" ;

    glview:description """We examined the role of both intermediate-sized gaps and a dense shrub layer on subsequent tree seedling recruitment in a southern Appalachian deciduous
forest. We monitored the density of tree seedlings in twelve artificial gaps
and adjacent canopy controls under two contrasting understory conditions.
Half of the experimental gaps were dominated by the dense, shade-producing
shrub, Rhododendron maximum, while the remaining gaps were relatively open.
Canopy gaps 20 m in diameter were created by girdling canopy trees, leaving
standing dead trees with minimal disturbance to the understory. Density of
first-year and >first-year seedlings was monitored in transects extending
from adjacent undisturbed forest through the experimental gaps. Our clusters of experimental gaps were located in two mixed oak stands that bracket the elevation range of this community, hereafter referred to as ?low elevation? (850 m) and ?high elevation? (1100 m) sites. Sites had a
northeast aspect and slopes ranged from 30 to 50 % (high elevation) and from
45 to 70 % (low elevation). At both sites, we established six plots (12
plots total), each corresponding to a single experimental gap. Three of the
six plots at each elevation had a dense R. maximum understory, while three
plots lacked R. maximum. R. maximum has a patchy distribution at these
sites, permitting us to locate experimental gaps (with and without R.
maximum) in close proximity, thus allowing for consistent overstory
composition, slope, soils, and microclimate. Locations for experimental gaps
were selected in 1991, and canopy trees were marked for girdling to produce
gaps of approximately 300 m2 (expanded gap definition, Runkle 1981). Up to
five trees from a variety of species were girdled to create each gap. A
transect, comprised of 40 contiguous 1 m2 quadrats, was established across
each planned gap. Transects were generally oriented in a north-south
direction. Transects included 20 central quadrats exposed to gap conditions
and 20 outer quadrats subtended by the surrounding canopy. There were a few
exceptions to this layout, due to topographic considerations or patchiness
of the R. maximum. In these cases, transects deviated from a north-south
orientation or were interrupted to maintain consistent understory conditions
(e.g., R. maximum or non R. maximum). Following collection of pretreatment
data in 1993, we produced experimental canopy gaps by girdling trees in late
summer of the same year. The herbicide Garlon was applied to trees that
leafed out the following spring. Girdled trees remained standing for the
duration of our study, although large branches began to fall in the 4th
year. We censused tree seedlings along all transects annually in July or
August from 1993 to 1997. We identified all seedlings and saplings less than 2 m
tall to genus or species (for Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and
Quercus prinus). Seedlings classified as Betula spp were likely Betula
lenta, because Betula allegheniensis is restricted to the highest elevations
at Coweeta. We were unable to confidently differentiate all seedlings of Q.
velutina, Q. coccinea, and Q. rubra, so these are grouped as Q. rubra-type.""" ;

    glview:description """From an article from this study In Press at the Canadian Journal of Forest Research Ecologists and foresters have long noted a link between tree growth

rate and mortality, and recent work suggests that interspecific differences

in low growth tolerance is a key force shaping forest structure. Little

information is available, however, on the growth-mortality relationship for

most species. We present three methods for estimating growth-mortality

functions from readily obtainable field data. All use annual mortality rates

and the recent growth rates of living and dead individuals. Annual mortality

rates are estimated using both survival analysis and a Bayesian approach.

Growth rates are obtained from increment cores. Growth-mortality functions

are fitted using two parametric approaches and a non-parametric approach.

The three methods are compared using bootstrapped confidence intervals and

likelihood ratio tests. For two example species, Acer rubrum and Cornus

florida, growth-mortality functions indicate a substantial difference in the

two species abilities to withstand slow growth. Both survival analysis and

Bayesian estimates of mortality rates lead to similar growth-mortality

functions, with the Bayesian approach providing a means to overcome the

absence of long-term census data. In fitting growth-mortality functions, the

non-parametric approach reveals that inflexibility in parametric methods can

lead to errors in estimating mortality risk at low growth. We thus suggest

that non-parametric fits be used as a tool for assessing parametric models. Living and recently dead trees from a variety of trees were cored. Ring widths were measured with a Windendro Measuring System.""" ;

    glview:description "</field> Project Overview | Fact: Tree mortality at small spatial scales represents background levels of forest disturbance in the southern Appalachians, and is the dominant and most frequent initiator of change in terrestrial ecosystems. | Hypothesis: Large-scale and rare episodic events (i.e., hurricanes, ice, etc.)may do more to influence tree replacement and stand composition in the long-run than do small scale tree mortality events. | Overall Question: What is the ecological significance of small scale mortality events with respect to biotic and abiotic responses. | Approach: Experimentally create typical (less than 300 m2) canopy gaps (girdling and herbicides) at two elevations in Rhododendron and non-Rhododendron areas. | Measurements: | -automated micro-environmental measurements (air and soil temperature), photosynthetically active radiation, %WC. | -hemispherical photography | -dendrometer bands and repeated measurements | -population dynamics and seedling physiology | -in situ closed core N mineralization and nitrification | -small and large mammal seed and plant herbivory using exclosures | Specific Questions: | 1)How are microclimate and nutrient (N) cycling affected by small scale canopy removal? | 2)What are the physiological and productivity responses of advanced regeneration? | 3)Whate is the productivity response of non-gap-maker trees (dominants, co-dominant, and saplings)? | 4)What strategy for recovery is most likely (seedling recruitment, sapling ingrowth, canopy closure)? | 5)How do all of the above relate to/regulate each other? | 6)What is the effect of elevation on response? | 7)How do responses differ in Rhododendron versus non-Rhododendron areas? Soil and Air Temperatures | Thermocouples were installed at 1m above the forest floor (air temperature) and 10 cm below the forest floor surface (soil temperature) and were co-located at 11 locations along permanent transects in all non-Rhododendron gaps and 1 Rhododendron gap at each elevation. Only 1 Rhododendron gap was instrumented at each elevation because of the presumed lower variability in temperature beneath Rhododendron sub-canopies compared to ares without Rhododendron. The air temperature thermocouples were placed in a PVC shield to prevent artificial heating from direct solar radiation. Copper-Constantine wire (Type T) was used. Data were recorded automatically though a multiplexed system controlled by a CR10 data logger and down loaded periodically as needed. Data were scanned for obvious problems such as deteriorated thermocouples and repairs were made in the field as needed. The reason for monitoring soil and air temperature was to detect changes in understory microclimatic conditions due to the creation of the canopy gap." ;

While many studies have examined the direct effects of canopy gaps on seedling recruitment, few have considered the interaction of other sources of spatial heterogeneity with canopy gap formation. I examine the potential for spatial heterogeneity in understory cover, mineral resources, and moisture to interact with overstory condition to contribute to species coexistence. I created microsites with contrasting resource availability by removing understory vegetation, trenching, trenching and removal of vegetation, fertilization, and unmanipulated controls. These treatments were replicated beneath closed canopy and canopy gaps. I planted 1080 seedlings of Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus rubrum in these microsites and have subsequently monitored seedling survival and growth. My results so far indicate that species and treatment greatly affect seedling survival and growth, but that species rankings do not change across treatment combinations in a manner promoting species coexistence.

    glview:description "</field>y exists between researchers who find detrital clays as an accurate proxy for continental (source area) paleoclimate interpretations, and those who express caution with respect to the use of clay mineralogy in retrospective analysis of climate. A means of gaining insight into this debate is by actually calculating rates of clay genesis, and identifying and quantifying clay mineral assemblages, in present-day terrestrial weathering environments where climate is known.  Source areas for terrigenous clay sediment may be placed along a continuum between two end-members;source areas are characterized by steep slopes where transport processes are more rapid than the weathering processes generating the clay, and transport-limited on gentle slopes whereby the maximum weathering rate exceeds the ability of transport processes to remove sediment. The latter pose the greatest concern for paleoclimatologists trying to use clay mineral assemblages from mudrocks and sediments to in erpret source area climate changes through geologic time. These concerns arise because clay detritus eroded from a transport-limited landscape may originate from paleosols, and not reflect the climatic conditions during erosion and transport of the clay to the depositional basin. A transport-limited environment may require several million years to develop a deep mature profile, and under such circumstances only long-term (1 or 2 Ma) paleoclimatic changes may be recorded in the clay mineral assemblages of the sedimentary deposits. | It is hypothesized that for the study area of the U.S. Forest Service Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), that the mass of a given clay produced per unit volume of saprolite per time is climate dependent. Furthermore, the weathering profiles developed on the hillslopes of CHL will possess characteristic clay mineral assemblages that also reflect climate and hydrology. | Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the temporal resolution of clay mineral assemblages in paleoclimatic reconstructions, as CHL is characterized by relatively high rainfall (200 cm/year), substantial erosion rates (3.8 cm/1000 years), a thick (6 m) modern (100 Ka) regolith, and extensive hydrochemical data for use in mass balance determinations of clay genesis rates. CHL also permits the calculation of rates of clay genesis in saprolite developed under different climatic regimes (i.e., catchments located at significantly different elevations), but with other variables held constant (e.g., bedrock, aspect, vegetation, weathering duration, etc.). Most important is that weathering (and clay genesis) at CHL is occurring at the present time. | In terms of the weathering continuum outlined above, CHL provides intermediate data between the two end-members, and, through calculation of clay genesis rates, will permit determination of the resolution of the paleoclimatic record in deposits of clay minerals derived from source areas similar to CHL. This study will calculate rates of clay formation, and identify clay mineral assemblages, for weathering profiles (saprolite) which only vary by climate. Such data are essential if the clay mineral assemblages of ancient mudrocks and sediments are to permit accurate paleoclimatic interpretations. Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory was chosen for the study because it maintains a continuous collection of data needed for the mass balance equations used for calculating clay genesis rates, including precipitation data (with solute chemistry), biomass data, stream discharge, and stream solute data. This study will utilize two pairs of watersheds. For a given pair, one watershed will be located at a significantly different elevation (and hence climate) than the other with all other variables being identical. Watershed (WS) 34 (low flushing rate and lower temperature) will be paired with WS 2, as both overlie Tallulah Falls Formation bedrock. WS 36 (high flushing rate and lower temperature) will be paired with WS 18, as both straddle the Shope Fork Fault, and hence overlie both Tallulah Falls Formation and Coweeta Group bedrock. This investigation will evaluate watersheds of all combination of temperature and flushing rate; that is, low temperature and low flushing rate (WS 34), higher temperature and higher flushing rate (WS 2), very low temperature and very high flushing rate (WS 36), and higher temperature and low flushing rate (WS 18). | Field sampling will be performed within the applicable watersheds on as complete weathering profiles as possible. Ideally, bedrock, a thick sequence of saprolite, and soil will all be present. Samples may be collected from outcrops, road cuts, and/or trail cuts, possibly also including use of a hand auger or soil probe. When vertical profiles are available, regolith may be sampled as frequently as every 10-20 cm through the section. Samples will be collected by driving a sampling tube (approximately 4 cm in diameter and 8 cm long) into the weathering profile. The bedrock underlying watersheds 2, 18, 34, and 36 is heterogeneous, and hence sampling will be performed spatially in such a manner that allows weathering profiles on similar (hopefully identical) bedrock to be compared. Lithologic variability will be evaluated using geologic maps and bedrock descriptions published by Robert Hatcher. | Based on the above discussion, a small quantity of vegetation at each sample location will need to be removed in order to gain access to the regolith and bedrock. Penetration into a vertical exposure will likely be no deeper than 30 cm, and will be performed one time only. Sampling performed by hand coring will only disrupt an area the diameter of the probe. The cored hole will be backfilled upon completion of sampling. Based on previous experience in the southern Appalachians, even vertical exposures of saprolite and soil revegetate quickly. No hazardous materials are involved during sampling, nor any special safety consideration, other than basic field safety." ;

    glview:description """Relationships between vegetation surface area and streamflow are well known for Coweeta watersheds. However, watershed analyses provide no information on the role of species in regulation transpiration, and hence streamflow. Basic information on differences in species-level transpiration rates is critical for understanding vegetation-water quantity interactions at small and large scales. Our specific questions for this study include:

1. How different are transpiration rates among species?

2. How does climate affect transpiration-interactions among species?

3. How do tree age and size affect hydraulic conductance and transpiration?

4. Do these differences, if they exist, change with succession?

5. Is there any relationship between tree-level tranpiration and annual, seasonal,

and diurnal streamflow? None Available""" ;

Statistical models have been developed to relate temperature and precipitation to leaf morphological and wood anatomical characteristics. Now these models need to be thoroughly tested to determine their validity and precision. | The proposed work entails the collection of leaves and associated wood from native angiosperms in forested areas whose climate parameters are known. The physiognomy of leaves and wood will be used, in conjunction with existing climate models, to estimate temperature; these estimates will be compared with actual site temperature to determine the accuracy of the models and to refine their precision. At least 20 native species (preferably more if more species are present) of dicotyledonous trees, shrubs and woody lianas will be selected at each site. Each tree will be assigned an identification number, and approximately 10 leaves will be collected. Leaves will be collected by clipping the tip of a small branch or from the ground. The leaves will be preserved in a plant press immediately to be later archived in our collection. Secondary xylem samples will then be removed from each tree using a 12 mm increment borer. The hole left by the borer will be left open or plugged with modeling clay dependent on the requirements of the station. The wood samples will be preserved in %50 ethanol in glass jars." ;

of decomposition. So, leaf litter with herbivore damage and frass additions will

decompose more quickly than leaf litter with herbivore damage and no frass

    glview:description """There is a general consensus that the global climate has slowly warmed

(0.6 degrees C) over the past 100 years and that this trend will continue at an accelerated rate over the next 100 years (1 degree - 6 degrees C) (Kattenburg et al. 1996). Aside from the mean annual increase in temperature, the frequency of weather extremes, such as heat waves, drought, and tropical storms are projected to increase across North America over the next century (Easterling et al. 2000). Past changes in temperature and precipitation have been accompanied by changes in insect and vertebrate distributions from both tropical and temperate environments (Parmesan 1996, Pounds et. al 1999). | We have developed bird-habitat models that allow us to predict the occurrences of species in specific forest types within and across national forests within the Blue Ridge physiographic province with a high degree of accuracy (Linder et al. submitted). These models categorize habitat as 

unsuitable, marginal or high quality as determined by the rate of occupancy over five years of point count data. | We will validate our occurrence models with reproductive data. We hypothesize that reproductive success will correspond to predicted habitat 

quality. While stochastic events may obscure patterns in the short-term, long-term reproductive trends should reflect site quality. We will collect demographic data from habitat plots occurring along an altitudinal gradient. Our altitudinal gradient will consist of four sites, two each at approximately 600-700 meters, and one each at 850-950 and 1100-1200 meters. Plots will consist of a core area of 10 ha which will have weekly density and territory mapping for all avian species. We will use teams of nest searchers following the protocol of Martin and Guepel (1993) to find nest within the 10 ha core area, eventually working their way out, expanding the periphery until the total area reaches 40-50 HA. We will estimate nest success (Mayfield 1975), and when possible, document annual reproductive success for all females. | Nest searching will take place during the breeding season of 2002 at Great Smoky Mountain National Park and Coweeta Long-term Ecological Research Station. By focusing our efforts in a limited number of plots, we will be able to collect intensive data on multiple species simultaneously. We selected the avian species of interest based on past habitat-species modeling supported with information from the literature (Hamel 1992, Nicholson 1997). We will monitor reproductive success of 2 avian species, Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) a habitat generalists, and Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica cerruleuns), restricted to upper elevations at southern latitudes. | We predict that as the climate warms, the available habitat for the high-altitude avian species will shift up the elevation gradient, resulting in the contraction of high quality habitat patches, degrading a large proportion of 

available habitat from suitable to marginal. By examining the differences in 

reproductive parameters, we may predict impacts of climate change on the future viability of the selected avian species. | Habitat descriptors will be measured at each nest found and from random points within study plots, allowing us model the habitat preferences of each species, and to examine potential differences in reproductive effort among the study plots. The habitat descriptor will include elevation, slope, aspect, forest type, stand size, stand age, condition class, litter depth, ground cover (%), canopy cover (%), canopy height (m), shrub cover (%), total stems by species, total stems, number of trees in the following size classes (DBH in cm) (10-15, 15-23, 23-30, 30-38, 38-50, 50-68, greater than 68), total number of trees greater than10 cm DBH and tree species richness. Site-specific microhabitat will also be characterized at each point-count station. | Nest success data will be used to create demographic models based on habitat variables that have proven important in predicting the occurrence of avian species in the forest types (Linder et al. unpublished data). Since the DISTRIB model predicts distributional changes resulting from climate shifts for each tree species individually, we will also create occurrence models for avian species with response variables based on the occurrence and abundance of individual tree species. This will allow us to address the potential problem of spatial variation in avian model parameters (e.g. pairing success or reproductive success). We will also conduct sensitivity analyses on each model to determine the relative importance of individual parameters. Parameters based upon sound empirical data that are also deemed sensitive typically indicate which particular parameter has a strong influence on a populations viability. However, sensitivity analysis may also highlight which parameter(s) may require additional research to determine the accuracy of estimation. | The products from the combination of field data and analysis will provide a validation of bird occurrence models using features at both the landscape (biotic and abiotic features) and plot (tree species importance values) scales. Should data allow parametric statistics, we will use t-test for distinguishing differential reproductive success between marginal and high-quality habitaat as predicted from bird occurrence models. If not, we may use either Fischers exact test (a x2 test) or Mann-Whitney U-test (non-parametric ANOVA). The reproductive data will also allow us to create (but not validate) models predicting nesting success based on habitat data. We will construct these models using stepwise logistic regression, with habitat features as predictor variables and nest success as the response variable. We will then combine these models with species occurrence models (Linder et al. unpublished data) to predict reproductive success by habitat quality across the entire southern Appalachians. Finally we will begin the construction of population viability models for species using both qualitative (habitat associations) and quantitative (nes ing success) data and apply the models across virtual forests created via the climate change projections, creating avian response to climate change models (ARCC). Results from these ARCC models may facilitate the identification of species at risk from future contraction and isolation of breeding habitat.""" ;

We believe that these beetles may use fungi to eat fungi. Basidiocarps to be examined are the spore-containing structures of agarics and polypores. Our preliminary study indicates specificity in some of the yeast-beetle associations, although presumably nonsymbiotic yeasts with less specificity also may be present. Until now, yeasts and yeast-like fungi were known only from the gut of planthoppers (Homoptera) and three families of beetles (Coleoptera): (Anobiidae, Cerambycidae, and Scolytidae). The sampling strategy will emphasize a range of localities and basidiocarp habitats that are likely to produce the greatest diversity; and also will allow us to acquire specimens to address contextual issues including species specificity, yeast metabolism, biogeographical variation, competition, population biology, evolution of symbiotic associations, beetle substrate expansion, and evolutionary radiations.  Destructive sampling is necessary to obtain basidiomycete fruiting bodies, the insects inhabiting them and the yeasts in the gut of the beetles.

    glview:description "Altitudinal gradients are specifically correlated with climate, precipitation, and numerous other variables; variables which must be taken into consideration when designing effective conservation studies in the Southern Appalachians. Furthermore, community relationships along elevation gradients can specifically be used to predict effects of global and local climate change. Salamanders and other amphibians are extremely good indicators of the overall health of an ecosystem, but many species of salamanders have begun to die out within the Southern Appalachians. Therefore, it is necessary to survey salamander populations along an elevation gradient in order to study the effects of disturbance in the Southern Appalachians, predict the results of global climate change upon salamander populations, and design ways of combating present disturbance within salamander populations. This study will consider the relationship between the number and diversity of salamanders at each elevation with altitude, climate and precipitation. Adjacent to each gradient site, 25 plots will be partitioned off within a grid quadrat. Plots will be at least 6 meters from each other. Within each plot will be two 1X1 ft cover boards made from pine shelving wood, which is not chemically treated. Coverboards with each plot will be placed 1 inch apart from each other.

Surveying will begin the first week of July and will occur bi-weekly until August 17th. Surveying will then occur at least twice more between September and November.

    glview:description "This investigation will explore the effect that current timber extraction techniques have on plethadontid salamander populations in the Nantahala National Forest (Nantahala N.F.) of western North Carolina. Over the past 120 years, the Nantahala N.F. has been shaped by a variety of harvesting techniques including individual tree selection, clearcutting, shelterwood, group selection, and two-age harvest. Broad scale timber extraction can drastically alter the structure and microclimatic conditions of forest ecosystems resulting in elevated ground and air temperatures, decreased soil and litter humidity levels, loss of leaf litter, and the gain or loss of coarse woody debris. Post extraction forest stand changes can have a direct effect on the abundance and diversity of plant and animal species that reside in the forest landscape. This study will focus on the response of plethadontid salamanders to various timber harvesting methods over time. Plethadontid salamanders were chosen for this study because their physiological attributes, life history characteristics and high sensitivity to habitat perturbations make them especially suited as indicators of forest biodiversity and health. At each site, a point shall be designated as the plot center. From the plot center, a 50 x 50 meter plot shall be established following the study design employed by Petranka et al. (1994). To control for the confounding effects of forest edge, all plots shall be located a minimum of 15 m from uncut forest or in the case of control plots, 15 m from cut forest. A natural cover search method shall be used (turning all logs and rocks in the plot) during daylight hours to locate and record the relative abundance and species richness of salamanders for each plot. Additional information to be collected at each plot will include leaf litter depth, percent canopy closure (for two-aged and control plots), and a classification of coarse woody debris (amount, size and degree of decay). | There should be minimal disturbance to the study site due to the rolling of decayed logs.

    glview:description """The purpose of this study is to collect data in previously harvested timber stands to quantify the differences in herbaceous diversity over timber treatment types. Biodiversity will serve as a surrogate for over-all site health, and thus the \"sustainability\" of a certain treatment type. Harvested sites that have biodiversity measures more similar to undisturbed sites will be considered sustainable harvest. Using the GOS Method, developed by the Carolina Vegetation Survey, the following types of sites were surveyed: undisturbed for at least 50 years, sites that were formally used for agriculture, but have naturally re-forested over 50 years ago and clear cuts, high intensity partial cuts and low intensity partial cuts over a range of ages since treatment. Using ordination and residual analysis, relative differences in treated stands can be quantified in relation to untreated stands. Thus, timber harvesting methods that result in comparably lower herbaceous diversity can be identified in this watershed. This data set will serve as a first step in what will ultimately become a sustainable management plan for timber harvest in the Little Tennessee Watershed. 

Study_Dataset_Keywords: Sustainable forestry, forestry, sustainable forestry practices, herbaceous diversity, timber extraction The GOS method has been developed by the Carolina Vegetaion Survey (also called \"Pulse\"), for accurately describing the vegetative community in a given area. (See Peet et al. 1998. A flexible, multipurpose method for recording vegetaion composition and structure. Castanea 63(3):262-274.) In this type of data collection, a 50 x 20 meter plot is located in the treated area. This area is divided into ten 10 x 10 meter modules. Four of these modules are intensive modules. The other six modules are reffered to a Residual Modules. In two corners of each intensive module nested plots of increasing sive (10 x 10 cm, 31 x 31 cm, 1 x 1 m and 3.1 x 3.1 m) are surveyed for plant species. A plant identified in the smallest plots is given a presence class of 5 and thus a plant found only in the entire 10 x 10 meter module is recorded as a presence of 1. In each plot of increasing size, only new species that were not found in the preceding plot are recorded. This procedure is repeated in the other 7 intensive corners in the plot. After each module is surveyed in this manner, each species found is given a number which corresponds to a Percentage Cover Class. This data is important to show the relative importance for a certain species, and because of the bias inherent in using this kind of data, should always be performed by the same person. In the residual modules, new species are identified that were not found in the intensive modules. Again, cover classes are assessed. In all 10 modules, all woody stems above DBH are identified, measured and placed in specific diameter classes (cm). Four soil samples (one from each intensive module) of about a 10 cm diameter, are taken from the A-horizon. If a B-horizon can be reached, one sample of that is taken. In addition, specific descriptions of each horizon are recorded. Descriptive base line data needs for each site include: slope (degrees), aspect (degrees), bearing of plot center line (degrees), Physiognomic class (Forest, woodland, etc), Dominant Leaf Type, Dominant Leaf Phenology, Hydrologic Regime, Drainage, Salinity, Topographic Position, Landform type, Mcnab Indices (position within landscape, plot microtopographic shape), Ground cover estimations (%) (bryophyte/lichens, decaying wood, bedrock/boulder, gravel/cobble, sand/soil, litter/om, water, and \"others\"), canopy height (m), Percent Cover by Strata (Herb, shrub, understory, canopy and emergent), any distubance notes, GPS coordinates, photographs (4 of the canopy and 4 from the plot center in each of the 4 cardinal directions), and any other notes that the researcher may find important for data analysis. Data must be collected in this manner as an integral part of the study relies on comparing the data collected from the harvested sites to undisturbed data collected both by the current researcher and past data collected by the Carolina Vegetation Survey. Model building and data analysis will begin with a large body of data taken by CVS in undisturbed areas. Residual analysis will come into play when the \"disturbed\" sites are incorporated into this model.""" ;

Forty-two proposed sites (GIS layer submitted to Brian Kloeppel) were selected at random from the non-control portion of the Coweeta basin according to three criteria: 1) to enable access, points are within 200m of a driveable road, 2) points are stratified by 3 elevational classes, 3) points are also stratified by 3 classes of Topographic Convergence Index, a proxy for soil moisture. At each site clusters of 4 5x5m plots will be laid out, one plot in the center and three others at random within a 30m radius of the center plot. Plots will be identified by PVC corner posts. Stand composition surrounding each point will be estimated. A complete census will be made of all woody stems 0.5m tall to 5cm DBH, with stems identified, mapped, and measured for basal diameter, total height, and height of bud scar. A subset of these stems will be cut live at the base to measure long term growth rates via annual ring increments. Cut stems will also be measured for canopy height and radius, stem taper, stem biomass, leaf area and mass, and leaf N. This will allow the refinement of allometries for the sapling stage, and in particular allow the estimation of intersite plasticity. Plots will be recensuses annually for sprouting of cut stems and growth/survival of uncut stems. For all subplots,canopy photos will be taken annually, soil moisture will be measured annually, slope and aspect will be measured initially, and a short (15cm) soil core will be taken initially, dried, and archived at Duke. The same design will be used for additional plots outside the Coweeta LTER, both in the Southern Appalacian region (Mars Hill and Nancytown sites) and in the Carolina Piedmont (Duke Forest )." ;

    glview:description "</field>e size and range edges of plant species are believed to be controlled by environmental factors and life history characteristics. Among life history traits, seed dispersal mode is an important autecological characteristic that has the potential to influence various aspects of species interactions with the environment, yet its role in determining patterns of distribution and abundance on large geographic scales is not well understood. This study will examine the influence of seed dispersal mode in determining patterns of postglacial migration, northerly range extent and the location of modern range edge for an assemblage of six herbaceous species with differing seed dispersal modes in the deciduous forests of eastern North America. The primary research approach will involve a comparative phylogeographic analysis of congeneric or closely related forest herb taxa with differing seed dispersal modes. Genetic analysis of chloroplast DNA variation across species ranges will be used to reconstruct the history of population fragmentation during Pleistocene glaciations of North America and the subsequent expansion of populations during the Holocene. Comparative analyses of migration patterns and population genetic structure among plant taxa with differing seed dispersal modes will be used to assess the improtance of seed dispersal mode in determining rates and patterns of Holocene recolonization. The project will involve a comparative phylogeographic study of six forest herb taxa: Actaea pachypoda, Cimicifuga racemosa, Jeffersonia diphylla, Podophyllum peltatum, Uvularia grandiflora and Polygonatum pubescens. Several of these forest herb taxa occur at the Coweeta LTER; these species would be the focus of sampling during my visit to the site. Phylogeographic analyses utilize variation in molecular markers to study geographic patterns of relatedness between populations. In plants, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is commonly used because it is often variable at the population level and is maternally inherited (i.e., via ovules); consequently, it can provide a direct measure of migration via seed dispersal. By screening for cpDNA loci that exhibit variation among plant specimens from across a species range, it is possible to develop a phylogeny which can be geographically referenced to infer the history of population fragmentation and expansion. For this study, leaf samples of approximately 2 x 2 inches would be collected from 5-20 individuals of each of the focal species at each of 30-40 population sites across the southeastern United States, Midwest and Northeast. One to three populations of each of the focal species occuring at Coweeta LTER would be identified in consultation with Coweeta LTER staff and sampled during a one to two day period in June of 2003. Leaf samples would be collected from 5 - 20 individuals in each of these populations. The sampling procedure should not substantially harm plants sampled; no plants would be collected in whole, dug up or otherwise disturbed or destroyed. The leaf samples from these populations would be transported to Cornell University with other leaf samples from the southeastern United States for processing and screening for cpDNA polymorphisms. The cpDNA haplotypes identified by this analysis and analysis of specimens from other regions of the eastern United States will be geographically referenced to examine patterns of cpDNA variation in relation to species range; specifically, the research will reconstruct patterns of Holocene migration for the selected focal species in eastern North America and infer locations of refugia and/or southern population centers during the glacial maximum. Comparative analysis of these data among related taxa with differing dispersal modes will evaluate the role of seed dispersal in driving rates and patterns of migration, and resultant range edge-range size dynamics." ;

    glview:description "For the southeast US, biogeography models predict an increase in aridity with vegetation changes from temperate deciduous forest to southern mixed forest if there are moderate temperature increases, or to savanna landscapes under drier scenarios (Bachelet et al. 2001). Given this forecast, I hypothesize that the colonization potential of coastal and more southern species in the North Carolina Piedmont and Southern Appalachians will be enhanced by a warmer and drier climate. The nature of this vegetation shift will mainly depend on the adaptability of these species to the specific characteristics of the sites. Considering that recruitment is the limiting stage for successful establishment of tree populations (Harper 1977), I propose to study recruitment limitation of potential migrant species relative to local trees in two regions in North Carolina, the Piedmont and the Southern Appalachians mountains. Experimental manipulations will allow the quantification of recruitment potential of non-native tree species and their performance with respect to native species. Field and greenhouse experiments will be used to develop and parameterize a model of community recruitment. I will employ the model to elucidate potential changes in forest species composition under a suite of future climate scenarios. Both data and modeling work are expected to improve our understanding about the mechanisms that may be involved in restructuring communities in the face of a changing climate. A few week-old seeldings of the following species will be planted at each location. Ten individuals of each species. The total area required at each location will be 25 m2.

    glview:description "In the southern Appalacians Rhododendron maximum thickets suppress conifer and hardwood regeneration. While there has been research on the effects of R. maximum on physical and chemical environment, the functioning of R. maximum ericoid mycorrhizas has been unexplored. The litter of ericaceous plants tends to be rich in phenolic compounds. These compounds can form recalcitrant complexes with various forms of organic N, and may be responsible for lowering decomposition and N mineralization rates. While polyphenol-organic N complexes are highly recalcitrant, some fungi, particularly ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, have the ability to access this sequestered N. Since the litter of ericaceous plants is rich in phenolic compounds and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi are equipped to degrade phenolic compounds, polyphenol-organic N complexing may represent an N cycling strategy that prevents non-ericaceous plants from accessing sources of organic N. We propose to examine the activities of polyphenol degrading enzymes in the soil of R. maximum thickets and neighboring hardwood forests. This study is a short-term and non-site-altering. Destructive sampling is limited to small soil cores. This research will not preclude any current or future use of the sites. Along high elevation ridges in Coweeta, we will establish five blocks of paired 3 m x 3m plots in R. maximum thickets and neighboring hardwood stands. In each plot, we will collect one composite sample for three soil horizons (Oi, Oa and A). Each sample will be a composite of 7-10 cores of approximately 15 g. Soil samples will be taken to the laboratory for enzyme analysis of polyphenol oxidase. Additional (approximately 100 g) litter and humus samples will be analyzed for polyphenols." ;

    glview:description "</field>eta? While examining the arthropod collections at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, we came across several series of Antrodiaetus unicolor that were collected from the Coweeta LTER site (please see specific localities/dates below). Interestingly, these spiders showed remarkable variation in size; furthermore, this size variation showed a strong correlation to the time of year. Large males were only collected in pitfall traps during September and October, whereas small males were only collected in November and December. This observation is intriguing. At a location several miles from Coweeta in extreme southwestern North Carolina, two highly divergent haplotypes of A. unicolor have been observed. Unfortunately, the specimens used for this part of the study were immature, so it is unknown whether these haplotypes belong to individuals with males of different sizes. We would also like to know if the size variation observed from that particular collecting season was an anomaly or whether there is a consistent and predictable pattern. It is also unknown whether females exhibit similar size variation. It is important that we collect these spiders at Coweeta because it appears that the area might be a zone of sympatry for two (or more) closely related species of Antrodiaetus. The results to be gained from this research will likely invite stimulating discussion about detecting species boundaries, historical biogeography, molecular evolution, speciation, character displacement, temporal isolation, and a host of other exciting biological phenomena. Locality Data: North Carolina, Macon County; Coweeta Hydrologic Station, Watersheds 2 and 7; pitfall traps; collected on 27-Sept, 13-Oct, 24-Nov, 19-Dec 1978 by Lee Reynolds. The primary objective of this research is to collect live (or well-preserved) mygalomorph spiders for subsequent molecular work. For the first phase of obtaining specimens, spiders will be collected using pitfall traps (consisting of two 20 oz. plastic cups). Approximately 20 pitfall traps will be set-up per watershed (2, 14, 34), distributed randomly across stream banks or near steep slopes. Each pitfall trap will be provided with a roof to minimize flooding; this roof will be placed approximately two inches above the rim of the pitfall trap to exclude small vertebrates (e.g., salamanders, small rodents). A bright orange flag will accompany each pitfall trap to designate its location. Traps will be left open throughout the autumn and will be checked at least once every other weekend until the sampling session is finished in December. Ten or more traps per watershed will be live traps; these pitfalls will not include a preservative. Instead, the trap will be filled moderately with leaf litter to allow the spiders a place to hide. The remaining traps at each watershed will be kill traps; these pitfalls will be filled approximately one-third to one-half full of absolute ethanol. The second phase of obtaining specimens will involve actively seeking burrows. When burrows are located, they will be excavated using a small digging tool (approximately 10 cm long and 0.5 cm in diameter). All excavated soil will be replaced immediately upon removal of the spider. This procedure usually results in a minimal amount of disturbance. At the end of the sampling period (i.e., mid-December), all of the pitfall traps and accompanying materials will be removed." ;

White pine needle litter was collected from a beetle-kill area of watershed 1 and oven-dried at 65 degrees C. Approximately 3 grams of this litter was placed in each litter bag and the bags were sealed with an aluminum identification tag. The litter-filled bags were oven-dried at 65 degrees C again immediately before being deployed in the field. On 13-14 March 2002, fifty litterbags were placed along the 40-m centerline of each of the 8 experimental plots, for a total of 400 bags. Five bags from each plot were carried along and taken back for weighing to determine any effects of handling. A correction factor was calculated and total initial bag weights were adjusted accordingly. Litterbags were retrieved on or near the 14th day of each collection month in April 2002, May 2002, June 2002, and July 2002 to capture the initial pulse of decomposition, and then continued in November 2002, March 2003, July 2003, November 2003, and March 2004. Bags were collected in a stratified random fashion and samples were oven-dried at 65 degrees C, weighed, ground and analyzed for C, H, and N using a Perkin Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer. Nitrogen concentration, or percent N, was determined from the CHN analysis, and N content was calculated by multiplying the percent N by the mass (g) of the field sample. A single exponential decay function was used to characterize and compare the loss of litter mass. After CHN analysis was done on ground litterbag samples, we selected 2 vials from each plot to be ashed. This subset of 96 samples was placed in the muffle furnace for 4 hours at 550 degrees C. Separate ash corrections were applied to beetle and non-beetle plots for each sampling date. Analyses were performed on dry-ash corrected mass values." ;

The ceptometer measures average PAR on 80 sensors located every 10mm along an 800mm sampling bar. All 8 plots were measured once on 2 July 2002, and 6 plots were measured again on 22 July 2002. In 2003, PAR was sampled monthly on 6 June, 11 July, 11 August, and 10 September. Four ceptometer readings were taken in the 4 cardinal directions in the center of each module; these were averaged to get a module PAR value, and then the module values were averaged to get plot PAR values. In 2002, total available PAR was determined by taking open area readings near each group of plots once before starting plot readings and once after completing plot readings. The 2 readings were averaged and the resulting value was used to calculate PAR for those plots. Two ceptometers were available in 2003, which allowed for unattended PAR recording in nearby open areas and plot PAR recording to occur simultaneously. In unattended mode, the ceptometer records PAR readings every minute and then averages those every half-hour. Each module PAR reading was compared with the automated PAR reading for the nearest half-hour. Percent transmission was calculated by dividing plot PAR values by the corresponding total available PAR value." ;

    glview:description "Research over the past century has shown that where earthworms are abundant, they significantly influence soil processes critical to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Recent interest has focused on impacts of invasive, exotic earthworms on soil processes, particularly in temperate regions. Dramatic effects of introduced earthworms on soil organic matter dynamics have been reported in a number of cases. The focus of nearly all of this work has been on a few species of exotic earthworms which have achieved wide distributions and now dominate the soil fauna in many ecosystems. Moreover, the most dramatic effects of exotic species on soil organic matter dynamics have been observed in areas previously uninhabited by earthworms (e.g., north of Pleistocene glacial margins in North America). Such effects have rarely been reported from invasions of ecosystems inhabited by native earthworm assemblages, particularly where soils are undisturbed. These observations lead to the central hypothesis of this proposal--endemic earthworm fauna and/or characteristics of their native habitats are resistant to invasion by exotic earthworm species and, consequently, will reduce the impact of exotic species on soil processes. Objectives of this proposed work are to address the following questions: A) Do native earthworm species maintain exclusivity or dominance over exotic earthworm species in undisturbed, native ecosystems? Three hypotheses will be tested concerning mechanisms by which exotic earthworms may succeed or fail to invade a range of habitats occupied exclusively by native earthworms: 1) propagule pressure hypothesis; 2) habitat matching hypothesis; and 3) biotic resistance hypothesis B) Are the impacts of exotic earthworm species on soil processes reduced in the presence of native earthworm species in their native ecosystems? Effects will be determined of native and exotic earthworms and their interactions on transformations of soil organic matter in O- and A-horizons by measuring: 1) physical and chemical nature of organic and mineral soil horizons; 2) movements of 13C from labeled litter through O- and A-horizons and into organic matter fractions in the mineral soil." ;

    glview:description "Vast areas of arid regions around the globe are covered by shrubs of a unique growth form. These shrubs possess strongly segmented woody roots and stems that often split apart as the shrub matures, in many cases resulting in complete fragmentation of the plants. These species are often dominant in their native habitats and include Larrea tridentata and Ambrosia dumosa in North America, Zygophyllum dumosum and Artemisia herba-alba agg. in Israel, as well as numerous Artemisia species in the northern hemisphere. Previous studies have speculated that axis segmentation increases the chances for survival of the whole genetic individual, but at the cost of loosing parts of the plants to drought-induced mortality. However, much of the previous research on this growth form has been restricted almost entirely to descriptive studies of their wood anatomy, leaving open the question of if and how axial segmentation contributes to fitness and survival of these plants. To begin to test whether axial segmentation is restricted to arid land plants in particular, we will document the prevalence of axial hydraulic segmentation in shrubs from a variety of genera along a North America aridity gradient South of 35° latitude. We further hypothesize that within species that ultimately showed physically split axes, axial hydraulic segmentation of the xylem occurs prior to the development of physical splits. To test this hypothesis, we will map pathways of water transport in the xylem using injected dye tracers in a wide range of species along the aridity gradient in individuals that show no indication of physical segmentation." ;

    glview:description "The mountains of western North Carolina are one of the most botanically diverse regions in the world. Many  plants native to the region are recognized to have significant medicinal properties. Recent growth in the medicinal plants industry provides an opportunity for western NC to utilize its unique biodiversity and environment to develop alternative agricultural and industrial enterprises for its citizens. The key to a successful and sustainable medicinal herb industry is the development of �identity-preserved� domesticated medicinal plant varieties and systems for their propagation and agronomic production. Identity-preservation is a system of agricultural and industrial supply and production that ensures a controlled source of high quality plant products containing reproducible active ingredient level. Such a system will be critical to the development of successful markets. This proposal focuses on the identification of native plant resources, genetic, phyto-chemical, and agronomic evaluation of those resources, and subsequent development of systems for their propagation and agronomic production. Initial studies will focus on bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis), a native plant with recognized market demand. Bloodroot germplasm will be collected from the wild within the Natahala, Pisgah, and Cherokee National Forests of western NC and additional sites along the spine of the Appalachian Mountains. The collected materials will be transferred to an �ex situ� accession collection for genetic �fingerprinting� using AFLP analysis. Collected accessions will also be evaluated for alkaloids and agronomically desirable traits including yield and pest resistance. High yielding accessions selected will be used for development of identity-preserved varieties, seed and rhizome-based propagation methods, and small and medium scale agronomic production systems. Additional experiments will be focused on development of seed and rhizome-based propagation and agronomic production systems for bloodroot. Working relationships will be developed between researchers and possible grower groups as well as those companies currently purchasing bloodroot. The ultimate goal of the project is to bring the results of our research to growers and purchasers in order to create a new niche crop for small farmers in western NC." ;

    glview:description "Understanding the factors affecting the spatial distribution of mycorrhizal fungi in soils is critical to understanding their impacts on forest communities. I investigated the vertical distribution, of ericoid (ERM) ecto- (ECM), arbuscular (AM), and mycorrhizal fungi in a soil at Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, Otto, N.C., and attempted to determine if this spatial distribution was correlated with N and P fraction distribution. The soil studied maintained host plants for all three mycorrhizal fungi, Rhododendron maximum (ERM), Tsuga canadensis (ECM), Liriodendron tulipifera (AM).. We utilized DNA sequencing to determine mycorrhizal fungal distribution. Sequences were identified using BLAST searches and by utilizing Maximum-Likelihood analysis. The correlation between mycorrhizal fungal distribution and N and P distribution was tested using Principal Component Analysis. The results indicate that the three mycorrhizal types are differentially distributed throughout soil horizons. ERM fungi occurred predominately in O horizons and AM fungi occurred mainly in B horizons. The majority of ECM fungi were located within the A horizon but were found in the O and B as well. ERM fungi were positively correlated with high concentrations of inorganic N and organic N and P. AM fungi were negatively correlated with inorganic and organic N, while ECM occurred throughout the range of N and P fraction distribution. I hypothesize that this fungal distribution relates to the capacity of each fungal type to utilize various soil substrates as nutrient sources. As a secondary study, I investigated the impact that different mycorrhizal types have on root system architecture. Using PCR and sequencing, I identified the different mycorrhiza occurring on roots of each of the three host species. I then used scanned images of each root fragment to determine several topological parameters including altitude, magnitude, and total exterior path-length. Comparisons of the topology of roots colonized by different mycorrhizae indicate that different ECM groups do not have a noticeable effect on the parameters measured. Other comparisons could not be made due to a lack of AM and ERM diversity on the roots tested." ;

Two susceptible taxa are of particular concern: red oaks (especially northern red oak, Quercus rubra) and rosebay rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum). Northern red oak is highly valued for its timber, and is an important mast source. In the forested environment, rhododendron has little economic value, but plays a significant role in regulating forest community dynamics. It restricts understory development and forest regeneration through the dense shade it casts and its recalcitrant litter. Because sudden oak death can kill not only canopy trees, but also may eliminate or reduce a \"keystone\" understory species that strongly regulates forest regeneration, its effects on ecological functions are likely to be quite significant." ;

    glview:description "The purpose of this study is to survey small mammal communities across western North Carolina to collect baseline information on the current distribution and population status of selected special concern species. Current target species are Rock Vole Microtus chrotorrhinus carolinensis, Oldfield Mouse Peromyscus polionotus, Allegheny Woodrat Neotoma magister, S. Appalachian Woodrat Neotoma floridana haematoreia, Southern Bog Lemming Synaptomys cooperi stonei, Long-tailed Shrew Sorex dispar, Water Shrew Sorex palustris punctulatus, and Least Weasel Mustela nivalis. Our objectives are to document the continued existence of these mammals at known historical locations in western North Carolina, survey for additional locations occupied by these species, and to assess the relative abundance of these species in North Carolina. My records indicate the presence of water shrews at 3 locations within the Coweeta boundary. Coweeta provides a large area of suitable habitats for water shrew, long-tailed shrews and rock voles. It is advantageous for Coweeta and the NC Wildlife Resources Commission to verify continued existence of water shrews as well as the presence of other targeted species." ;

    glview:description "</field>outhern Appalachians, Rhododendron maximum (Rm) thickets suppress overstory regeneration. While there has been research on the effects of Rm thickets on physical and chemical environment, to this point, the functioning of Rm litter and ericoid mycorrhizas (ERM) has been unexplored. We examined the possibility of a N feedback between litter and ERM fungi in high elevation hardwood forests at the Coweeta hydrologic lab. Rm thickets increase leaf and root litter inputs and Rm soils contain two times as much C and eight times as much N in the organic horizons, compared to hardwood soils. Rm litter also has a greater capacity to create protein- tannin (P-T) complexes in laboratory assays. Together, these results suggest that the greater amount of organic matter and organic N under Rm is a function of litter quality and the formation of P-T complexes. While P-T complexes are recalcitrant, the mycorrhizal fungi of ericaceous plants, ERM fungi, have the ability to access this sequestered N via extra-cellular polyphenol oxidases (PPO). We found soil PPO activity to be significantly greater under Rm in the O horizons compared to hardwood soils. Rm litter polyphenols may create a pool of organic N that is recalcitrant to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) overstory recruits, yet remains available to Rm itself. However, an examination of the movement of N from P-T complexes into Rm biomass, compared on a relative basis with N movement into ECM and AM overstory trees is necessary to provide closure of this proposed positive feedback between Rm litter and ERM fungi. We propose a field tracer study using 15N labeled P-T complexes to quantify movement of 15N into soil pools and root biomass. Conducting this study in the field provides clear relevance to the research question as 1) microbial and mycorrhizal fungal communities will be unaltered, 2) ERM, ECM and AM roots coexist under Rm, and ECM and AM coexist in hardwood stands, 3) N inputs from the tracer in our plots can be placed into the context of N budgets estimated from our previous work." ;

The litter is then separated by category, dried, weighed, and processed in a Wiley mill for later nutrient analyses.

    glview:description """None Available All of the data originated in the riparian watershed (WS 55) at Coweeta. Thus far, all soil data occurred in 1994 - ie. before the rhododendron removal. The summary C and N files are saved by date (year, month,and day). Within each file are data for Microbial carbon and nitrogen. The sample names (ex. C1-1, 0-5) indicate control plot, 1 meter distance from the stream, sample number 1, at the 0-5 cm soil depth, and so on. T would indicate treatment plot and 5-10 indicates

the 5-10 cm soil depth. Within each plot (C and T), we established three transects, 10 meters in length, at 1, 5, and 15 meter distances upslope from a stream. Along each

transect, 4 samples were collected and each sample consisted of two bulked soil

cores, separated by depth (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm). All sampling dates were in 1994, beginning in March. Sample dates were selected to correspond with seasonal changes and occurred March 25, June 16, August 16, November 1, and December 16. Microbial C data is listed as microgram C per gram dry weight soil, followed by an average of C (measured by distance from the stream) and standard deviation corresponding to that average. ND listed in the data set indicates that the sample needs to be reanalyzed or was missing.  The december data set needs more work, but I have included it anyway. | Microbial nitrogen is listed as microgram of total persulfate N per gram

dry weight soil. This is again followed by an average N value by distance from

the stream and depth of the soil and the corresponding standard deviation. Methods: Microbial Biomass carbon and nitrogen; Soils were cThe chloroform fumigation - extraction method was used to determine microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (Vance et al., 1987). All samples were extracted with 0.5 M K2SO4 for 30 minutes and all extracts were filtered through Whatman 42 filter paper and stored frozen until analyzed for microbial C and N. | Microbial carbon was determined using a Shimadzu TOC-500 Total C analyzer to directly analyze the extracts as described above. Data are reported as microgram total organic carbon (TOC) per gram dry weight soil. The correction factor used for carbon was kc = 0.33 (Smith and Paul, 1990). | Microbial nitrogen was determined by the total persulfate N (TPN) protocol of Cabrera and Beare, 1993. In this protocol, an aliquot of extract was first digested with a persulfate oxidizing reagent and then analyzed using an Alpkem RFA 300 colorimetric spectrophotometer. Data are reported as microgram TPN per gram dry weight soil. The correction factor for nitrogen was kn = 0.38 (Voroney and Paul, 1984).ollected as described above and then refrigerated until all samples were picked free of roots and recognizable plant material.

    glview:description """The effect of Rhododendron maximum, a dominate species in the riparian zones of the Southern Appalachians, on carbon, water, and nutrients en route to the streams is an ongoing study in the LTER research program at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. To study seedling establishment, growth, and dynamics in riparian zones one m2 quadrats have been established. There are four sites which include one treatment site, where the rhododendron has been removed from the riparian zone, one hurricane site, where there is extensive disturbance from Hurricane Opal, and two control sites, one upslope from the treatment site and one upstream from the hurricane site. Each of these fours sites have ten randomly located natural regeneration one m2 quadrats as well as four randomly located replicates of three adjacent one m2 quadrats. In each of the three adjacent quadrats, the litter was removed from the lower half to determine the effect of litter on the germination and growth of seedlings. Two of the adjacent quadrats have been broadcast seeded with Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus rubra. In one of the two quadrats that have been broadcast seeded, a predator exclusion mesh screen, 1m x 1/2m with 1/4inch openings, has been installed in the quadrat to determine the effect of small mammal predation on regeneration. Quadrats were installed on 24 April 1997 and an initial vegetation survey was conducted in May 1997. All seedlings were permanently tagged at this time and quadrat physical characteristics such as slope, aspect, and distance from stream were recorded. Broadcast seeding was done on 21 May 1997. Each year censuses will be conducted in spring and fall on each quadrat and seedling species, density, age, and annual height growth will be recorded. This project will help to document the effect of Rhododendron maximum on regeneration in the riparian areas as well as the effect of hurricane disturbance on regeneration. There are four sites, located in watershed 55, in this study. One treatment site, AR, had the rhododendron artificially removed in

August, 1995. The second treatment site, HR, experienced extensive disturbance from Hurricane Opal in October, 1995. These are the sites of the ongoing riparian study to determine the effect of removal of the streamside rhododendron on the export of hillslope nutrients (K, Na, Ca, Mg, N, P, S) and organic matter. There are two control sites. One is located upslope from the artificial removal site, AC, and the second is located upstream for the hurricane removal site, HC. These sites have not been disturbed.  Within each site, there are four randomly located replicates of three adjacent 1m2 quadrats, or plots.  Within each quadrat, there is a 1m x 1/2m subquadrat. Each subquadrat has had the litter removed from the lower 1/2m2 area and a mesh screen installed to separate the two areas.

Two of the subquadrats have been broadcast seeded with Acer rubrum, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus rubra. On one of these two subquadrats, a predator exclusion mesh screen has been installed to exclude small mammals.  In addition to these plots, each site has ten randomly located natural regeneration 1m2 quadrats.""" ;

Overall levels of soil phosphorus at Coweeta were low, for all labile forms of P measured. Watershed 55 is divided into two plots which contain three transects each, located 1, 5, and 15 meters upslope from the stream channel. The rhododendron removal occurred in August 1995 and windthrow caused by hurricane Opal occurred in October 1995.

The purpose of the project is to determine the effect of removal of streamside Rhododendron maximum on the export of nutrients and organic matter, on microbial community function, on downslope coarse woody debris transport, on seedling regeneration, and on microclimatic variables such as soil temperature and soil moisture. Two experimental hillslope transects that span topographic flowpaths from a local highpoint to the stream were instrumented with lysimeters in two soil horizons, the BA (20-25 cm deep) and the B (40-50 cm deep). The vegetation cut was conducted on the \"treatment slope\" in Aug 1995. Shortly thereafter, Oct 1995, hurricane Opal blew down a significant number of canopy trees on the \"control slope.\" Due to this natural disturbance, the project was adjusted to contrast the effects of natural vs human disturbance - a bank of lysimeters above the cut area was unaffected and now serve as the control data for the project. The treatment slope has been renamed the \"cut slope\" and the hurricane impact slope has been renamed the \"storm slope.\" The project uses a terrain-fitted hillslope hydrology model (TAPES-C, IHDM4 hybrid) to account for water flux and nutrient loading from the hillslope before and after the cut and storm impacts. Two lysimeter transects were placed at the centerlines of surface flowpaths based on terrain analysis using TAPES-C software (Yeakley et al., 1994).  These surface flowpaths are connected to a common local highpoint (HP), and share a common flowpath from the highpoint to approximately 50 m down the slope before they diverge into separate pathways. Within the experimental

hillslopes, tension lysimeter plots are located at locations along each slope - streambank, 5 m from stream, 15 m from stream. A lysimeter sample plot consists of 4 sample sites in each of two horizons (BA: 20-25 cm deep, B: 45-50 cm deep). A total of 48 sample sites exist (4x2x3=24 sites on each hillslope).

    glview:description """Members of the Desmognathus complex have geographically isolated populations throughout their range and reproductive isolation between populations has been documented for most species. It is generally thought that geographic and the associated behavioral isolation has played a major role in the diversification of this genus (Tilley et al. 1978, Tilley et al. 1990). Desmognathus monticola does not appear to adhere to the typical pattern of geographic isolation observed elsewhere in the genus. The range of D. monticola has been proposed to extend between southern Pennsylvania and Georgia with a disjunct, state-endangered population recently reported in the Red Hills of Alabama (Conant and Collins 1991). The initial question presented is whether the entire range of D. monticola consists of disjunct, isolated populations, or if the Alabama population is unique in being isolated from a continuous northern range. To date, insufficient fieldwork has limited the documentation of the entire range of the species and it is possible that the Alabama population may not, in fact, be disjunct. If it is truly disjunct, then two hypotheses can be proposed. This population could be a recent derivative from the main range or an ancestral group that was isolated during the glaciation of the Appalachian Mountains. These hypotheses have not yet been tested. Establishment of a network of population relatedness will provide needed insights into this question. Additionally, D. monticola populations have no documented reproductive behavioral isolation between populations (Mabry pers. com). Lack of behavioral isolation in D. monticola as compared to its congeners may indicate that it is a recently derived species. To date, studies of Desmognathus have employed enzyme electrophoresis to examine genetic diversity, but little variation has been reported using isozyme data (Tilley et al. 1978). Similarly, our preliminary allozyme studies on D. monticola have revealed little genetic variation. Thus, a hypervariable DNA technique, such as Intersimple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs), is necessary to examine the genetic diversity within and among populations of this species. ISSR data are dominant/recessive markers that are scored as band present or absent (Gupta et al. 1994, Zietkiewicz et al. 1994). It is possible to construct a similarity matrix, examine the degree of differences both within and between populations, and establish a dendrogram of population relatedness (neighbor-joining and/or UPGMA tree). Field sampling: I will locate D. monticola populations throughout the proposed range from Pennsylvania to Georgia. To determine if the Alabama population is truly disjunct, it will be necessary to search for other populations in suitable habitat between Alabama and the southern extent of its range. Topographic maps will be examined to find potential locations of D. monticola populations. For all populations located, I will collect a small amount of tail tissue (less than 10mg) from 20 individuals. Vouchers will be documented using a digital camera. To assist in subsequent population location, GPS coordinates will be recorded for each population. | DNA Extraction and Genetic Analyses: DNA will be extracted using the Promega Wizard Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison). ISSR reactions will be conducted in 25mL volumes using standard methods (Wolfe and Liston 1998). DNA will be electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, stained using ethidium bromide, and bands will be viewed using ultraviolet light. All ISSR reactions will be replicated to test for the presence or absence of each band. Pictorial documentation of bands will be taken using Kodak EDAS Package, and scoring and sizing of bands will be conducted using Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software Package (Eastman Kodak Corporation, Rochester). Similarity matrices will be constructed and these data will be analyzed using NTSYS (Applied Biostatistics, Inc.) | Interpretation of population data: A network of relatedness between populations will be established based on ISSR analyses. If populations between the southern range of the species and the Alabama population are found, then a continuous range will be indicated and bands will be studied to determine polymorphism, and presence of band subsets. If the Alabama population is disjunct, then it will be possible to examine its position in the resulting dendrogram. A basal position may indicate it is ancestral. However, if it is clustered with the Appalachian populations, I will conclude it is a more recently derived population. In addition to cluster analyses, careful inspection of the ISSR bands lend insights into the origin of this population. For example, a shared subset of bands found in the Appalachian populations would indicate a recently derived population. A high proportion of unique bands may indicate a more ancestral population, as sufficient time has passed for the accumulation of mutations (Soltis and Bloom 1991).

Ideally, we would like to distribute the sampling over at least 10 streams or watersheds, to minimize the impacts on the population of any given stream. In the field we simply turn rocks in and along streams and capture the salamanders by hand.

    glview:description "We are looking at a diversity cascade beginning with leaf litter in the riparian zone and stream. Using the four dominant tree species in the watershed, we will study their content and decomposition rates and their effects on subsequent trophic levels. We would like to examine possible effects of increase in diversity on break-down rates, nutrient identity and availability, and microbial and faunal diversity and biomass. Beyond these core questions, we are interested in examining specific terrestrial and aquatic responses to land-use change variables. From this, we hope to determine if leaf litter diversity, a common indicator of land use, has an impact on ecosystem diversity, which may have possible effects on ecosystem function. Senesced leaves from the four dominant species will be collected in the fall of 2003, dried, put into litter bags, and placed in the stream and riparian zone over approximately a 30-50 m reach. Sream litter bags will have a 15 mm mesh size and terrestrial litter bags will have a 1 mm mesh size. Three replicate bags per sampling date will be placed randomly in the study area and allowed to decompose. We will sample leaf packs according to anticipated rates of decay. For the stream, this will likely be on days 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160. For the riparian zone, this will likely be on months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36.

    glview:description "We examined the role of macrobiota in structuring the benthic communities of two low-order southern Appalachian streams, one draining intact forest (Ball Creek) and one draining pasture (Jones Creek). Fishes and crayfishes were excluded from areas of both streams using an electric exclusion technique; chlorophyll a, ash free dry mass (AFDM), and invertebrates were sampled over a 40-day period. In both streams, chlorophyll a and AFDM were higher in exclusion than control areas, although these trends were not consistently significant across all sampling dates. In Jones Creek, significantly more large (> 4 mm) aquatic insect larvae were found in exclusion that control areas, most likely due to exclusion treatments providing a refuge from macrobiotic predators. This refuge effect was also evident in Ball Creek, were exclusion treatments contained significantly more filterers. Results indicate that macrobiota influence the structure of southern Appalachian benthic communities, by decreasing the amount of organic matter (algal and detrital) available for other consumers and by preferentially preying upon certain sizes and taxa of invertebrates. Compared to some low-order tropical streams, however, macrobiotic influences are low. Weaker effects may be attributed to decreased abundance of macrobiota and increased influence of benthic insects in southern Appalachian streams. 1.None Available" ;

    glview:description """We examined the effects of competitive interactions and prey patch dynamics on patch selection by a predatory benthic stream fish. Using mark-recapture techniques, we characterized the movements and space use behaviors of juvenile and adult mottled sculpin in a southern Appalachian stream. We then related these behaviors to spatial variation in benthic invertebrate colonization rates and small scale changes in local prey abundance. Observations made on the individual movements of sculpin indicated two distinct behavioral patterns: 1)despotic patch use, and 2)periodic patch abandonment. Our results on prey patch dynamics indicated that these behaviors were mediated by spatio-temporal variation in invertebrate distribution and dispersal. Adult sculpin maintained activities within patches of high prey abundance and exhibited persistent use of patches characterized by high invertebrate colonization rates. In addition, we found that patch abandonment by adult sculpin was induced by changes in the local abundance of invertebrate prey. In contrast to adults, patch use by juveniles appeared to be controlled primarilly by size-dependent competitive interactions. These results indicate that the dynamics of patch use by sculpin are controlled simultaneously by the dynamics of their patchily distributed prey and age/size dependent competitive interactions. 1.We sampled sculpin population seasonally (Spring, Early and Late Summer, Autumn) in each of four years (1994, 1995, 1996, 1997). Within each season we made a series of four sampling passes. During each pass we snorkeled the study site and capture individual sculpin with dip nets. Individuals were

weighed (nearest .01g) and measured (nearest 1mm) and given a unique mark using acrylic paints injected subcutaneously. We mapped the location of each individual using triangulation procedures. Individual movements were characterized as the distance between subsequent captures of the same individual over time. We measured microhabitat variables at each location (depth, current velocity, and substrate composition). We quantified invertebrate abundances within patches occupied by sculpin.

    glview:description "We examined the influence of physical variables and prey distribution on habitat use by longnose dace at the scale of individual stones, foraging patches (i.e. groups of stones separated by smaller than 12m), and stream reaches in summer and fall, 1996, and spring 1997. At the scale of individual stones, we failed to detect a significant correlation between prey density/stone and longnose dace for aging effort (# bites/stone), even though there were large differences (i.e. up to 200x) in prey density among individual stones. At the foraging patch scale, longnose dace chose patches with significanlty greater prey densities than were available from randomly selected stones in summer and spring, when prey were distributed in distinct patches, but did not select high-prey patches in fall, when prey were uniformly distributed. In addition, longnose dace avoided patches with depositional physical characteristics in all seasons. At the reach scale, longnose dace were signficnatly under-represented in depositional reaches in all seasons. Among erosional reaches, prey density was significantly different among reaches in all seasons, and prey density/reach was positively correlated with longnose dace density/reach in all seasons. Our results indicate that the spatial distribution of physical variable and prey concurrently affect habitat use by longnose dace at multiple scales. 1.Data were collected by directly observing actively foraging longnose dace through snorkeling. We snorkeled the site until 20 long nose dace had been observed in each season. We observed each longnose dace until it had foraged upon 4-5 stones, recoreded the number of bites taken from each stone, and placed brightly colored lead weights adjacent to each stone. Once 20 fish had been observed, we centered a 400 cm² viewer above each foraged upon stone and measured the following physical characteristics: depth, focal and mean (60% depth) current velocities, and substrate composition." ;

    glview:description "We investigated the impact of urbanization on benthic invertebrate diversity and community composition of 12 streams in western North Carolina which differ in the amount and type of development in their watersheds. Urbanization in the southern Appalachian area affects stream communities based on the type (residential, commercial, or industrial) and degree of development. We quantified urbanization from 1970 until the present using several metrics generated from GIS overlays of land cover, aerial photographs, and field exploration in the study catchments. In addition to land use, quantitative benthic samples of invertebrates and organic matter were taken, and a number of water chemical and geomorphological variables were measured. Invertebrate diversity decreased with increasing urbanization(less forest cover and greater building density). The NCBI values for invertebrates of these streams were positively related to road and building density suggesting dominance by pollution tolerant taxa when urbanization increases. Streams in primarily residential watersheds supported greater diversity than streams in commercial or industrial areas. Physicochemical variables showed similar relationships with land use metrics suggesting some possible mechanisms for the impact urbanization has on benthic macroinvertebrates. 1. Macroinvertebrates were collected using a quantitative kick net sampler (0.4 m2, 353 �m mesh net). Five samples were taken on each collection date. Water chemistry, suspended solids, epilithic solids, and physical measures were also measured.

    glview:description "</field>tigated the influence of land-use on benthic invertebrate assemblages in agricultural streams. We hypothesized that agricultural streams with forested headwaters would have different invertebrate assemblages than similar streams that were cleared to the headwaters. To test this hypothesis we compared benthic invertebrate assemblages in six agricultural streams (3 with cleared headwaters and 3 with forested headwaters) in the French Broad River drainage in western North Carolina. Benthic invertebrate samples were collected at three sites along a land-use gradient on each stream. Physical and chemical parameters, including stream discharge, substrate size and heterogeneity, nutrient levels, periphyton biomass and temperature, were also measured along the land-use gradient in order to identify processes which may influence invertebrate assemblages. Land use was assessed using GIS data at varying spatial and temporal scales. The forested agricultural streams have had more riparian vegetation than the cleared agricultural streams since the 1950s, and this trend continued into the 1990s. In general riparian area in forest cover increased from 1950s to the 1970s, although no consistent changes have occurred from 1970s to 1990s. Environmental variables differed between these two stream types, often in response to riparian vegetation but also in response to specific land use. The environmental differences generally coincide with differences often found between forested and agricultural streams. The two stream types also supported different invertebrate assemblages. The forested agricultural stream invertebrates were generally more diverse and more represented by sensitive Plecoptera taxa. Within each season, the invertebrate assemblages at each site were grouped primarily according to present degree of agriculture. The influence of current agricultural practices, particularly heavy cattle impact, interacts with historical forest cover to explain current invertebrate diversity. This may indicate a long term legacy of agriculture, i.e., influences of past agriculture on the stream may persist and influence invertebrate assemblages for up to 25 to 50 years. In addition, the land use immediately upstream explains more variation in diversity than the land use of the entire watershed. The importance of the upstream segment in explaining variation in diversity also indicate that the immediately upstream influences may override the conditions which may be present in the headwaters. 1.The study sites were three second- to third-order agricultural streams with forested headwaters and three similar agricultural streams which were cleared to the headwaters in the French Broad River Basin near Asheville, North Carolina. The six streams are located within Buncombe and Madison counties in the Blue Ridge Province of the southern Appalachian mountains. The three forested headwater agricultural (FA) streams originated in forests which gradually opened to cleared, agricultural areas: Heck Creek (a tributary of Walnut Creek), North Fork of Ivy Creek, and Upper Flat Creek. The three cleared headwater agricultural (CA) streams drained areas which have largely been cleared to the headwaters: North Turkey Creek, Pawpaw Creek, and Willow Creek (a tributary of Sandymush Creek). Sampling regime. The six streams were sampled at three sites (headwaters, intermediate, and a downstream site). Invertebrates were sampled (using a Surber sampler fitted with 500 um mesh) in October 1996 and April 1997. A range of physical and chemical variables were measured up to six times during the study. These variables included stream discharge, substrate size and heterogeneity, benthic organic matter, nutrient concentrations, and periphyton biomass. Temperature was recorded continuously by dataloggers at each intermediate site (Site 2) and by maximum-minimum thermometers at each upstream (Site 1) and downstream (Site 3) site." ;

    glview:description "We examined the impact of predatory benthic fishes and crayfishes on macroinvertebrates colonizing a patch in areas of sustained and variable foraging pressures. The ability of predators to affect the population and community structure of their prey in stream environments is largely debatable. Four main hypotheses have surfaced to explain the varying results of predators impact on prey, but they have yet to be tested simultaneously as done in this experiment. These hypotheses offer varying predictions about the ability of stream predators to influence prey populations and community dynamics: 1) predator effect prey populations through consumption or emigration of prey. 2) predator effects are swamped by rapid movement of prey into and out of an area. 3) prey respond to predators by hiding; reducing the ability of the predator to find the prey, and potentially increasing localized density of prey. 4) stream predators do not impact prey populations or community structure. We tested these four hypotheses in Ball Creek, a 3rd order stream, with a relatively simple predator community. Two benthic fishes, mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) and longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae) and one crayfish species (Cambarus bartonii) are the large benthic predators present in the system. Moreover, previous research has demonstrated that adult sculpin tend to stay in patches for a season. Therefore, by observing adult sculpin we could predict that that area is being foraged by that sculpin. Therefore we could test our predation hypothesis using exclosure cages in areas where the sculpin are located, and in areas of unknown foraging status (random patches). 1.Fifteen mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi) greater than 4.5 cm in length were observed by snorkeling. We chose fifteen constrained random patches of similar velocity, depth, and substrate composition. Random locations had to greater than 1m away from a sculpin location and were stratified to be equally represented in 5 m sections of the reach. Drift samples were taken at all location using Miller plankton nets for 20 minutes at sunset, sunrise, and midday to measure immigration rates. We filled two baskets with scrubbed substrate, covered one with 5mm hardware cloth, and placed them in the stream bottom at each location. Behavioral observations of a random subset of the baskets were performed every 5 days; all predators seen at the baskets were recorded. We removed the baskets after three weeks, placing them immediately in large plastic containers to prevent escaping invertebrates. All rocks were scrubbed, and all macroinvertebrates and sediment less than 5 mm was preserved for lab analysis. All drifting and basket invertebrates will be identified to the lowest practical level to determine functional feeding group. We will measure all basket and benthic invertebrates to construct a size frequency histogram, and we will determine biomass of all invertebrates in the baskets. We will compare the number, community structure, and biomass between the open and closed baskets in all areas and between the sculpin and random areas. We will also compare the number of drifting insects between the sculpin and random in order to detect potential swamping. Moreover, we will test for hiding by examining differences between the proportion of insects found in the top vs. bottom layers in open vs. closed baskets." ;

    glview:description "Wood and leaves are the primary source of organic material in many small streams. Previous studies have suggested that availability of leaf litter influences the rates of decomposition of leaves and wood (Webster and Waide 1982). In this study, we are investigating the relationship between leaf litter availability and leaf and wood breakdown. We hypothesize wood substrates decompose faster in an area of stream without leaves compared to one with normal leaf litter amount. We also speculate that wood and leaves decompose slower in an area of stream with increased leaf litter compared to one with normal leaf litter amount. 1.We selected three 10-m sections of the stream for our study. Each section was divided from each other by about 20-m. We used this separation length in order to minimize the effects of one site on another site. We removed all of the leaves from one 10-m section (exclusion site) and placed them in another 10-m section (inclusion site). The remaining 10-m section is used as a reference site. The sequence of sites on the stream is exclusion (most upstream), reference, and inclusion (most downstream). At each site, 20 white oak leaf substrates (hereafter referred to as leaf packs--10- g each) and 15 white oak veneer substrates (hereafter referred to as wood strips--2.5- cm by 10-cm; attached in groups of three to a section of gutter screen) were placed near the middle of each site. We are collecting samples at the following dates after initial placement: 30-d, 60-d, 90-d, 120-d, and 150-d. We take subsamples from each wood strip and leaf pack in order to find decomposition rates of each substrate. Respiration of wood strip and leaf pack biofilms are measured using a Gilson Respirometer. In addition, ash free dry mass (AFDM) is measured from each of these subsamples. With inter-site data comparisons, we will look at breakdown of wood and leaves in relation to leaf litter availability in a stream environment. Also, macroinvertebrates will be collected from each leaf pack. Diversity and density from each sample will be analyzed. We will use these data to look at macroinvertebrate colonization behavior of leaf substrates in relation to leaf litter availability in a stream environment." ;

    glview:description """The LINX project was a cooperative study among 11 institutions comparing the dynamics of nitrogen in streams at 12 sites ranging from the North Slope of Alaska to Puerto Rico. The central hypothesis of this project was: The considerable variability among streams in uptake, retention, and cycling of nitrogen is controlled by key hydrologic, chemical, and metabolic characteristics that determine water retention, degree of nitrogen deficiency, and energy flow through food webs in stream ecosystems. We used simulation modeling, field tracer (15N) additions, and an intersite comparative approach to address this hypothesis. 1.The field tracer additions were done at each site, beginning in November 1996 and completed in fall 1998. In the two weeks prior to each tracer addition, we made several measurements including: short-term injection of a conservative tracer to determine hydraulic characteristics of the stream; short-term injections of nutrients (NH4, NO3, PO4) to determine relative uptake lengths and potential nutrient deficiency; and pre-addition measurements of 15N in 15 significant stream food web components. The 15N (as 15NH4) addition lasted 42 days. During this addition period, stream components were sampled at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days. Also during this period, stream metabolism (primary production and respiration) was measured

    glview:description "I. Project Scope | The Valley and Ridge is perhaps the case example of how rock type and structure influence topography, with alternating layers of bedrock with varying resistance to erosion forming long ridges and valleys. Classical treatment of the fluvial systems in the Appalachians considers the ridges and valleys to be in equilibrium. Relief and form are essentially governed by lithology, and most trunk streams are at grade with their given rock type (Hack, 1954). What has been overlooked, however, is that trunk streams are only a portion of the story. The majority of the surface is actually drained by non-perennial headwater streams (generally 1st - 3rd order), which control the erosion of the hillslopes. Alternating stratigraphy with mixed resistance underlies these streams, in contrast to the trunk streams, which flow over bedrock with similarly weak resistance. We will examine headwater channels to determine if bedrock resistance controls the relief and topography of the ridges, as opposed to drops in base level or climate change. The entire Valley and Ridge fluvial system works together as a coupling between headwater and trunk streams to transport sediment out of the system. Trunk streams carry out sediment transport in the valleys, with the majority of sediment transported in effective discharge events that recur on average every 1.5 years (Wolman and Miller, 1960) and shape the channel. However, headwater streams, which are the pathway for sediment transport from the hillslopes, may require more extreme and infrequent precipitation events to generate effective discharge and channel forming flows. We will determine what precipitation events are important for sediment transport in headwater channels, as well as controls on sediment transport and storage. Holocene climate change and recent land use may cause stream channel changes, if the channel crosses a geomorphic threshold as boundary conditions change. Bull (1979) hypothesized that thresholds of stream power for erosion or sedimentation are important for describing ephemeral channel behavior. We will examine the sensitivity of headwater channels to such boundary changes as climate and woody debris removal and attempt to predict how these changes affect headwater processes and hillslope erosion. For example, it has been suggested that thick aggradational sequences in valleys represent a previous climate in which hillslope erosion by ephemeral channels was more effective than trunk streams ability to transport sediment. By studying how channels function today and comparing this to the Holocene record of sedimentation events, we may be able to get a sense of how ephemeral channels respond to changes in climate. The sensitivity of channels to thresholds will also be studied by looking at the effects of recent modifications to the system (i.e. effect of logging). | II. Objectives: | 1. Determine controls on headwater channel profiles and geometry and how they vary with the resistance of underlying bedrock. | 2. Determine recurrence intervals of effective discharge events in headwater channels and how they vary with drainage area and bedrock. | 3. Determine the sensitivity of headwater channels to changes in boundary conditions such as logging (woody debris removal) and climate change. | III. Our Approach | A) Collect a data set that enables comparison of channel geometry (cross section, long profile, etc.) and substrate to bedrock. This is easy in the Valley and Ridge, where channels cross sections of resistant and weak Paleozoic strata at different orientations. Very resistant layers hold up most ridges, but hillslopes between these ridges and the trunk streams may consist of a wide range of lithologies. This creates an opportunity to explore the equilibrium hypotheses. Headwater channels should be graded to all variations in bedrock along their entire reach. If not, then perhaps bedrock is not the most important thing. | B) Develop an understanding of ephemeral chaannel function. What is effective discharge and what is the recurrence interval of such events? To get at this we have made some real-time observations of large precipitation events in Allen Hollow, and will continue to monitor this site. We will also do simple modeling of rainfall/runoff routing, discharge and velocity, and effect on sediment entrainment, to see what events are really important for erosion and sediment transport in these channels. Some side questions we may address are what controls channel initiation, what the role of groundwater flow may be (qualitatively), what the effect of woody debris is on sediment storage, etc. | C) Investigate the sensitivity of ephemeral channels to threshold changes. To get at this, we will study channel geometry and substrate in areas of different landuse (but similar bedrock, relief, aspect, and so on) to see if minor variations in things like the presence of woody debris can actually change the channel significantly. This comparative study is possible because of sites of known 20th century landuse and logging history. A second way we can address this is by comparing short term to long term erosion and sedimentation; by excavating aggradational fans at the base of these channels (such as Allen Hollow) and getting rates of sedimentation and frequency of events by radiocarbon dating. This gets at the question of variations during the Holocene due to climate change. 1.Survey of stream morphology in watersheds 10 and 34, including distance-elevation measurements the length of the stream (longitudinal profile), general classification of channel substrate, survey of log jams, and characterization of bedrock outcrops. At 3-5 points in the channel, channel cross-sections will be taken and pebble counts performed." ;

However, the dynamics of bacterial community structure and major factors controlling these dynamics remains unknown. Although some studies have suggested that the availability of organic material in streams could be the major factor controlling bacterial community structure, no comprehensive study has been conducted to test this hypothesis. The purpose of this study is to test two hypotheses: (1) Differences in the amount and source of dissolve organic matter (DOM) have a major influence on bacterial community composition; and (2) By exposing bacterial from a given stream to DOM from another type of stream, changes in taxonomic composition can be induced. The influence of DOM on bacterial community structure will be studied by comparing the structures of bacterial communities collected from 11 streams of varied DOM amounts and sources and by exposing bacterial community collected from streams with one type of DOM to water collected from the streams with another type of DOM." ;

Disturbances include altering riparian or catchment vegetation, increasing sedimentation, and elevating nutrient levels, which affect leaf litter input and leaf breakdown. The quantity and quality of allochthonous organic matter inputs may be a major factor affecting stream ecosystem function, however, few studies have assessed it. It is necessary to study stream organic matter dynamics in order to understand the effect of agricultural disturbance on stream ecosystems. This study will measure leaf litter input and leaf breakdown rates in southern Appalachians streams with differing degrees of agricultural and forested land use to assess the effects of agricultural on these habitats." ;

    glview:description "Understanding the effects of environmental gradient strength on species distributional boundaries may provide important insight into how species will reorient their ranges during the course of climate change, when gradient strengths as well as absolute values of temperature and rainfall will shift across the landscape. Many predictions of range redistributions take only absolute value shifts into account, but gradient strength may influence species� ability to adapt to local conditions. In steep gradients, gene flow between adjacent populations occupying very different environments may inhibit local adaptation in each. At the boundaries of their distributions, species may not be able to adapt to conditions as extreme as would be possible in shallower gradients, where gene flow would exert less of a retarding influence. I will investigate traits and factors influencing the upstream and downstream distributional limits of the Appalachian prosobranch snail Goniobasis proxima as a means for testing this hypothesis." ;

    glview:description "The hyporheic zone of a stream is a potential site for physical storage and biological processing of energy and nutrients. Long-term introduction of fine sediments is typical in agricultural catchments and may affect stream structure and function through alteration of the hyporheic zone. Chemical and physical qualities of introduced sediment may cause changes in biogeochemical characteristics and ecosystem structure of the hyporheic zone, subsequently changing its function. Changes in size and distribution of hyporheic sediments may also result in reduced hydraulic conductivity, limiting exchange with channel water and altering whole-stream function. The objective of the proposed research is to determine how agricultural sedimentation of southern Appalachian 2nd-3rd order streams affects stream structure and function through hyporheic alteration. This objective will be met through two research elements conducted in agricultural and forested streams. The first will test the effects of sedimentation on hyporheic structure and function at a bedform scale. The second will investigate how hyporheic sediment alteration at bedform scales affects stream structure and biogeochemical function at a reach/segment scale." ;

    glview:description "We will investigate the relative breakdown rates of Northern Red Oak, Chestnut Oak, and American Chestnut leaves in streams in WS7, a recovering clear-cut, and streams in WS 14, a long-term reference watershed at Coweeta. The oaks are a major component of southern Appalachian forests and are also major components of the allochthonous organic matter that provides energy to southern Appalachian streams. Oaks are susceptible to a variety of defoliators including the gypsy moth which is gradually moving down the spine of the Blue Ridge Mts. and will likely eventually reach Coweeta and the surrounding mountains. American chestnut was at one time a dominant forest tree in the southern Appalachians but is now virtually extinct except for snags that grow from old stumps and roots. We have documented that litter breakdown of various leaf species is consistently faster in Big Hurricane Branch than in Hugh White Creek and this has been the case over the last 20 years or so. This study will compare breakdown rates of two major canopy trees of the maturing forest in the two stream types to develop background information on the importance of potential loss of substantial numbers of these two tree species to gypsy moth defoliation. The chestnut experiment is being done in an attempt to gain some historical perspective on how the loss of a key canopy species might have affected stream detritus dynamics." ;

    glview:description "In order for restoration activities to be successful, managers need a good understanding of the dynamics inherent in a particular system. Entrenchment is a morphological condition which results from disequilibrium in aquatic systems due to the disconnection of a channel and its adjacent floodplain. In the southeastern Piedmont, this is most typically due to land use practices that eroded historic sediment from the hillslopes and caused the channel to aggrade. As the stream incised through this deposited sediment, it became entrenched. These types of streams, although prevalent throughout the Southeast and the focus for widespread restoration efforts, have not been quantitatively studied. This study focuses on the dynamics of entrenched stream reaches and how they respond during baseflow and flood conditions in relation to channel morphology, streambed composition, and sediment transport. A significant difference between entrenched and non-entrenched reaches is anticipated for width/depth, velocity, sediment particle size, and habitat characteristics. Modeling with HEC-RAS is proposed to show significant differences in the magnitude of entrenchment, overbank recurrence interval, bed shear stress, flow velocities, stream power, and tractive force between reach types. Findings from this study may affect how entrenched reaches are restored in the future." ;

    glview:description "To determine the effects of nutrient enrichment in a detritus-based stream, we have continuously enriched a headwater stream with N and P for 4.5 years and quantified the response at different scales of stream structure and function: microbial, metazoan, and ecosystem. The effects of enrichment in the treatment stream (Watershed 54, WS54) were compared to conditions in the reference stream (Watershed 53, WS53) and one year of comprehensive baseline sampling was conducted in both streams prior to enrichment. Our first objective was to assess the effects of nutrient enrichment on growth and production of organisms. Our second objective was to determine the effects of nutrients on the fate of carbon resources, which were altered via increased microbial metabolism and invertebrate consumption. Most data were analyzed using Randomized Intervention Analysis (RIA)(Carpenter et al. 1989), which was based on pre-treatment differences between the two streams to differences following nutrient addition. This study was the first to determine the long-term effects of nutrient enrichment in a system in which organisms derive most of their carbon from detritus or detritus-based prey. Nutrient addition profoundly affected the treatment stream, with effects propagating from microbes to ecosystem-level effects. Below are specific results. EFFECTS ON ORGANISMS Nutrient addition resulted in an increase in microbial biomass and production. We observed dramatic increases in leaf-associated fungal production and biomass and significant effects of nutrient addition on leaf-associated bacterial production, but not on bacterial biomass. Whereas production of fungi exhibited an overall average 211% increase in response to nutrient addition in year 2 of enrichment, bacterial production only increased by 60% compared to the control stream. The mean number of fungal species detected per sample date before enrichment and in the reference stream was 12-13 but this increased to 18.5 species during enrichment. Primary producers showed some response to nutrient addition, despite light limitation. Contrary to our predictions, we observed a significant increase in algal biomass as measured by chlorophyll a, but the response was largely limited to high light months. There was a significant effect of enrichment on biofilm AFDM, but without the seasonal effect seen with chlorophyll a. There was no significant effect on cell densities of algae. There has been no apparent change in algal community composition as a result of enrichment. Production and biomass of invertebrates increased in response to nutrient addition. There has been a significant effect of enrichment on invertebrate biomass measured monthly and invertebrate production in the treatment stream was 153% higher compared to trends in the control stream after 1 year. Leaf litter standing crop in the stream is declining. Long-term data indicate a significant regression between benthic leaf litter standing crop and invertebrate production. Data from yr. 1 indicate a much higher production in the nutrient addition stream than would be predicted from leaf litter standing crop. Our longer term predictions for invertebrate biomass in the treatment stream include a decline in production compared to the response we observed after 1 yr of enrichment, based on the decline in benthic leaf litter. Growth rates of invertebrates were enhanced by nutrient addition. We measured increased growth rates of invertebrates with short aquatic life cycles, but did not observe increased growth rates on invertebrates with longer life cycles. Chironomidae, the dominant collector/gatherers, grew ca. 30% faster in the enriched stream than in the reference stream among all size classes. Tallaperla maria, a long-lived leaf-eating stonefly, did not respond to enrichment in terms of daily growth rates. We have data on the C, N, and P content of consumers showing that some taxa have much lower body P content than others (i.e., Tallaperla maria 0.5%, Chironomidae . 1.1%). Lower body P content generally suggests a lower P requirement for growth. Thus, Tallaperla maria, and other taxa with lower body P, may not be nutrient limited. Rates of organic matter breakdown were accelerated by nutrient addition. We observed increased breakdown of rhododendron and red maple leaves as well as wood. Rates of leaf decay exhibited a ca. 70% increase in the treatment stream relative to the control after 1 year of enrichment, and a ca. 200% increase in the 2nd year of enrichment. Breakdown rates with nutrient enrichment for both leaf types were outside of the 99% confidence interval of long-term means. Rates of decay of wood veneers exhibited 477 and 795% increases in the treatment stream relative to the control after 1 and 2 years of enrichment, respectively. Organic matter standing crop and export were affected by nutrient addition. We have observed dramatic reductions in leaf litter standing crop in the treatment stream, as well as increased export of fine particulate organic matter (significant effect on seston yield via RIA). There was no effect of nutrient addition on dissolved organic carbon. Whole-stream metabolism was affected by nutrient addition. Measurements of whole-stream gross primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (R) were highly variable seasonally. Contrary to our prediction that there would be a greater response in R than in GPP, effects on GPP were greater than on R. This result, however, was based ona very strong positive response of GPP to nutrient addition in April when GPP rates were highest, particularly in yr 2, and less response of GPP at other times of the year. The positive effect of nutrient addition on R was more consistent throughout the year. Food quality of detritus, as measured by C:N and C:P increased with nutrient enrichment. We have found that P content of leaf litter is much higher in the enriched stream than in the reference stream (i.e., lower C:P and higher %P). We have not seen any remarkable changes in %N or C:N of leaf litter in the enriched stream, suggesting that microbes demand P more than N. Respiration on detrital resources increased in response to nutrient addition. Yes, we observed increased respiration on both leaves (50-70% stimulation) and wood (300-350% stimulation) in response to nutrient addition." ;

    glview:description "It is proposed that a long-term ground water research station be established in the Coweeta watershed�s Subbasin 34 as part of the NCDENR-USGS Piedmont-Mountains Ground Water Resource Evaluation Program (REP). The REP is tasked to identify and characterize fractured rock aquifers within various hydrogeologic settings in the Piedmont and mountains of N.C. Planners, scientists, educators, and the public are using the REP findings to understand, develop and protect Western NC�s ground water supplies. This work would utilize historic data collected in the Coweeta watershed (stream gage, soils, precipitation, and surface water quality data, geologic mapping, and others) and would compliment the research being conducted as part of the Long Term Ecological Project at Coweeta. One of the goals of the REP is to develop an understanding of the ground water occurrence, quality, and movement within the major rock types that comprise the Piedmont and mountains of NC. The Coweeta basin represents a rock type that has not been fully characterized. Specifically, Coweeta is underlain by, among other rock types, a Precambrian-age biotite gneiss of the Tallulah Falls Formation of the Blue Ridge Belt, a geology that is prevalent throughout much of Western NC. In Subbasin 34 the biotite gneiss is interlayered with pelitic schist and metagraywackes, and a body of ultramafic amphibolite and horneblend gneiss occurs near the ridgeline. Topography within the 82-acre Subbasin 34 is fairly steep and extends from about 3900 ft above mean seal level (msl) along the ridgeline to about 2900 ft msl at Shope Fork. Ground water discharge occurs along Bee Branch and Shope Fork. Bee Branch is a tributary to Shope Fork, which in turn empties into Coweeta Creek. Coweeta Creek empties into the Little Tennessee River. Gage records exist for Bee Branch back to 1938. A wide range of hydrogeologic data would be collected and analyzed for the basin, and findings would be compared to those of other hydrogeologic settings in the Inner Piedmont and Blue Ridge Belts of western NC." ;

    glview:description "Increased watershed development can elevate stream nutrient concentrations (Vitousek et. al. 1997), but little is known how this enrichment affects food web dynamics of aquatic systems and their surrounding terrestrial habitats. Stream enrichment increases leaf decomposition rates, alters benthic invertebrate community structure, and increases invertebrate secondary production (Cross 2004; Greenwood 2004). However, stream systems are linked to their surrounding terrestrial system via aquatic insect emergence; an aquatic subsidy of terrestrial food webs (Jackson and Fisher 1986; Sanzone et. al. 2003) and a possible pathway for changes in aquatic systems to impact terrestrial systems. Because resource subsidies typically flow down a productivity gradient, an increase in the productivity of a donor system may increase this resource subsidy and alter the food web dynamics of the recipient system (e.g., Sanzone 2001, Polis et. al. 1997). Since July 2000, we have been continuously enriching a first order headwater stream and have facilitated increased aquatic invertebrate production (Cross 2004), which may increase the aquatic insect subsidy to the terrestrial system. Therefore, changes in food web dynamics caused by nutrient enrichment may not be limited to aquatic systems, but may also cascade through the terrestrial system with unknown effects. To better understand how aquatic and terrestrial systems are linked, I will test whether stream nutrient enrichment increases aquatic subsidies to terrestrial systems. Using a 15N stable isotope tracer I will test three predictions. Prediction 1: Aquatic insect emergence subsidizes near-stream terrestrial spiders more than upland spiders. Prediction 2: Aquatic insect subsidies increase spider abundance, richness, and biomass near streams when compared to upland habitats. Prediction 3: Stream nutrient enrichment increases this aquatic subsidy." ;

    glview:description "We have been continuously enriching a detritus-based headwater stream for 5 years. We have observed remarkable changes in the production of heterotrophic microbes and invertebrates, and consequent effects on ecosystem function in terms of decomposition rates and carbon balance. As a result of our long-term nutrient enrichment, fungal production and activity dramatically increased, decay rates of leaf litter increased, benthic organic matter standing crop has been reduced and export of fine particulate organic matter has increased. Long-term data from these streams indicate that benthic invertebrate production is highly correlated with benthic organic matter. Thus, despite increased invertebrate biomass and production we observed after 2 years of enrichment, we predict that over longer time scales (> 4 yr.), annual invertebrate production will return to a lower stable mean in the treatment stream, based on carbon limitation. The first objective of this study was to continue the nutrient enrichment of this headwater stream for one year to examine longer-term trends in system changes. The effects we have observed in this system have been largely driven by fungal rather than bacterial response, suggesting a keystone role of fungi in driving the response of a detritus-based system to nutrient enrichment. The second objective of the study, therefore, is to determine the role of fungi in controlling the system-wide response to nutrient addition. We are currently testing the keystone role of fungi by reducing fungal response to enrichment (by continuous addition of a fungicide) and measuring changes in the response of other variables. Critical to our predictions is whether there is a synergistic, facilitative relationship between fungi and bacteria, or whether these groups of microbes compete (e.g., for labile carbon or nutrients). Whether bacteria respond positively or negatively to reductions in fungi will test these alternative hypotheses.

    glview:description "Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is a common tree throughout much of eastern North America and is currently experiencing widespread mortality due to infestation by an introduced insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). In the southern Appalachians, eastern hemlock is the only coniferous tree that commonly grows along streams. Organic matter inputs (such as leaves, needles, and wood) from riparian trees are the major energy source in headwater stream food chains and play important roles in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in streams. Relative to inputs from hardwoods, conifer organic matter is slow to break down in fresh water and can serve different functions. A shift from hemlock to hardwood dominance in riparian areas may have significant impacts for transformations and transport of particulate and dissolved materials in streams. The loss of small wood inputs, or twigs, from hemlock trees may be especially important. We hypothesize that hemlock twigs influence organic matter and nutrient dynamics in headwater streams because they have unique physical and chemical characteristics that make them effective retainers of organic matter. We added hemlock twigs to one stream and hardwood twigs to a second stream and are measuring their effects by quantifying organic matter standing stocks, ammonium uptake, and leaf transport distance." ;

    glview:description """Allometric equations were developed for mature trees of 10 deciduous species at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in western North Carolina, U.S.A. These equations included the following dependent variables: stem wood mass, stem bark mass, branch mass, total wood mass, foliage mass, total biomass, foliage area, stem surface area, sapwood volume, and total tree volume. High correlation coefficients (R2) were observed for all variables versus stem diameter, with the highest being for total tree biomass, which ranged from 0.981 for Oxdendrum arboreum to 0.999 for Quercus coccinea. Foliage area had the lowest R2 values, ranging from 0.555 for Quercus alba to 0.962 for Betula lenta. When all species were combined, correlation coefficients ranged from 0.822 for foliage area to 0.986 for total wood mass, total tree biomass, and total tree volume. Species with ring versus diffuse/semiring porous wood anatomy exhibited higher leaf area with a given cross-sectional sapwood area as well as lower total sapwood volume. Liriodendron tulipifera contained one of the highest foliar nitrogen concentrations and had consistently low branch, bark, sapwood, and heartwood nitrogen contents. For a tree diameter of 50 cm, Carya spp. exhibited the highest total nitrogen content whereas Liriodendron tulipifera exhibited the lowest. Study Area  | Trees were sampled in the Southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (35 degrees N, 83 degrees W) as well as an area 4 km to the south; both areas are on the Nantahala National Forest. All trees were selected from mature stands (i.e. > 80 years old) containing mixed oak [Quercus alba L., Quercus coccinea Muenchh., Quercus prinus L., Quercus rubra L. and Quercus velutina Lam.], hickory [Carya glabra (Mill.) Sweet, Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Kock. and Carya tomentosa (Poir.) Nutt.], red maple [Acru rubrum L.], sourwood [Oxydendrum arboreum (L.) DC.], sweet birch [Betula lenta L], flowering dogwood [Cornus florida L.], and tulip poplar [Liriodendron tulipifera L.]. The mean annual precipitation of the basin is 2035 mm, which comes from an average of 133 storm events per year (Swift et al. 1988). Steep topography at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory and in the surrounding area ranges in elevation from 675 to 1592 m. The soils are Inceptisols and Ultisols with A and B horizon depths ranging from trace covering to 70 cm (Velbel 1988). The younger Inceptisols occur at higher elevations and on rocky substrates and are typically Umbric Dystrochrepts and Typic Dystrochrepts (Thomas 1996). Inceptisols are also located in coves and are represented by Typic Haplumbrepts. The older Ultisols, found on mountain slopes, are depicted by Typic Hapludults and Humic Hapludults (Thomas 1996). || Field Measurements | Trees used in this study were selected by species, size, and location, and were harvested between June and August to reduce the effects of decreasing SLA (Kloeppel and Abrams 1993) and N translocation on nitrogen tissue concentrations (Day and Monk 1977). The range of species and sizes was selected to represent the distribution observed in over 400 permanent plots across the Coweeta Basin (Douglas and Hoover 1988). Trees were selected using a stratified random design (Avery and Burkhart 1994) so that sample trees would represent a wide diameter range (Table 1). After locating trees of a desired species, the individuals were examined for anomalies such as pathogen damage or atypical crown architecture due to proximity to gaps or roads; atypical trees were excluded from sampling. The study trees were chosen from numerous locations within the study area to encompass a range of sites for each species; no trees were taken from the treatment watersheds. Once suitable trees were identified and the diameter measured at breast height (DBH = 1.37 m), they were felled using a chain saw and the following variables were measured.Using a 25 m steel tape, we measured the height from the base of the tree to the base of the live crown (BLC), crown length, and total height to the nearest centimeter. The stem was divided into 1 or 2 m sections, depending on the size of the sample tree, and marked with spray paint; the crown, BLC to the top of the tree, was subsequently divided into thirds and marked. All limbs were removed and separated into crown position (e.g. lower, middle, and upper) based on the origin of the branch. This division accounts for the variation in the ratio of foliage mass to branch mass that occurs from the lower to the upper portion of the crown. A sub-sample branch, representative of the ratio of branch wood to foliage for a given section, was selected from each of the crown positions. This sub-sample was then weighed with a 125 plus/minus 0.05 kg digital scale (Intercomp, ST2000, Minneapolis, MN USA). We then weighed the remaining branches by crown position. The bare stem was cut into the 1 or 2 m sections and the individual log sections were weighed. We then cut a disk approximately 4 cm thick from the base of each log section to be used for determining water content and bark to wood ratios. Additional disks were cut from: the base of the tree, DBH, and BLC, and used to determine cross sectional sapwood area and sapwood volume. If a tree was too large to weigh (i.e. the 1 mm stem sections would exceed the capacity of the 125 kilogram scale), log volume from the base of the tree up to the point offeasible weighing was generated using Newtons log rule (Avery and Burkhart 1994). Disks were cut from the bottom, middle, and top of the log, and their circumferences as well as the total length of the log were recorded. || Laboratory Analysis | We separated the crown sub-samples into foliar and branch components which were then dried to a constant mass at 65 degrees C and weighed to determine moisture content. Prior to drying the

foliage, we selected ten representative leaves and separated the petiole from the leaf blade. The total area of the leaf blades was measured using a leaf area meter (LI-COR 3100, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA); the blades and petioles were dried (65 degrees C) and weighed to determine specific leaf area (SLA) and the ratio of leaf blade mass to total leaf mass. The fresh weight and circumference (outside bark) were recorded for the disks sampled from the base of each log section; bark and wood were then separated. We dried

the disks (65 degrees C) and weighed the wood and bark separately to determine wood mass:total mass and bark mass:total mass ratios as well as moisture content of the total disk. The disks taken from the base of the tree, DBH, and BLC were stained with a potassium iodide solution to determine heartwood-sapwood boundaries (Kutscha and Sachs 1962). We traced the total disk area and the sapwood-heartwood delineation on acetate sheets and painted them to make them opaque. We then measured heartwood and sapwood area from these tracings on a leaf area meter. The disks from the large stem sections, where volumetric estimations were needed, had a 10degrees wedge cut from the center to the outside edge of the disk (including bark). Wedge volume was found by volumetric displacement (Heinrichs and Lassen 1970) and mass was determined after drying to a constant mass (65 degrees C ) to calculate specific gravity. The total log section mass is then calculated by multiplying the average specific gravity of the wedges for each species by the volume of the log section. || Scaling | The total dry weight of the foliage or branches for a given section was calculated by multiplying the ratio of dried foliage or dried branches to the total dried mass of the crown section sub-sample by the total crown section dry mass. The foliage mass of the crown section can then be multiplied by the specific leaf area (SLA) and by the leaf blade mass:total leaf mass ratio to determine total leaf area for a given crown section. The correction of the leaf blade mass:total leaf mass ratio is necessary because the petiole, which is not used in the leaf area calculations, accounted for 5 to 13% of the total leaf mass in this study for Quercus alba and Carya

spp., respectively. Similarly, we determined the log section dry mass by multiplying (1 - moisture content) by the field wet weight, and calculated total wood mass and bark mass for the section from the ratios of bark or wood to the total disk dry weight. Stem surface area was calculated by multiplying the log section length (e.g. 1 or 2 m) by the average of the circumferences from the disks at the base and top of the log, and summing over all sections. Similarly, we calculated stem volume by multiplying the surface area of the disks by the log section lengths and summing over all sections. The top log section was considered to be conical. The surface area of the volumetrically estimated logs was calculated using a modified version of Newtons log formula where disk circumference was substituted for disk surface area. Total sapwood volume for a tree is given by the sum of the sapwood volume of the branches and the sapwood volume of the stem, which is the difference between the total wood volume (inside bark) and the heartwood volume. For this study the branch volume was assumed to be entirely sapwood; the branch volume is then equal to the total branch dry mass divided by the branch density (see Clark and Schroeder 1986). The geometric solids of total wood volume aand heartwood volume were computed by summing the volumes for the \"base to DBH\" section (frustrum of a neiloid), the \"DBH to the BLC\" section (frustrum of a paraboloid), and from the \"BLC to the top\" section (paraboloid) (Husch et al.1972). || Nitrogen Analysis | Foliar tissue nitrogen concentration was determined from approximately 50 leaves from each dried, crown position sub-sample. Branch tissue nitrogen concentration was determined on arepresentative branch from each crown position sub-sample. The tree as a whole was the experimental unit so the mean of the three crown positions were used in all nitrogen analyses. For stem tissue nitrogen analysis, bark, sapwood from the last two years growth, and a 10 degrees wedge from the remaining wood were sampled from disks equally spaced within the stem. The last two years of sapwood and the remaining wood were used as separation points to correct for sapwood area variation between trees (Son and Gower 1991). We sampled three to five disks per tree depending on tree size. On the smaller trees (greater than 15 cm DBH) up to one half of the bark and sapwood from each disk

was used. All samples were ground with a Wiley mill to pass through a 0.5 mm2 screen (size 40) and analyzed with a combustion elemental analyzer (2400CHN, Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA). Nitrogen content per component per tree was found by multiplying the nitrogen concentration for each tissue sample by the total dry mass of that component. Stem wood nitrogen content (excluding bark) was calculated following Son and Gower (1991). || Statistical Analysis | Simple linear regressions (PROC REG, SAS Institute Inc. 1985) were computed using log10 transformed data (to linearize) and took the form: [1] log10 Y = a + b*log10 X Where X is the stem diameter in cm at breast height, Y is the variable (e.g. stem wood, stem bark, sapwood volume, etc.), and a and b are the intercept and slope, respectively. Means were compared using the LSD mean separation test at the

a = 0.05 level for SLA and specific gravity (PROC MEANS, SAS Institute Inc. 1985). Pair-wise comparison of regression coefficients (PROC REG, SAS Institute Inc. 1985) were performed for the ring porous and diffuse porous models relating sapwood volume to DBH and foliage area to cross sectional sapwood area (Chatterjee and Price 1977). Regression analysis was also performed on tissue nitrogen content versus DBH to calculate values for predicted trees of diameters 10, 30, and 50 cm (PROC REG, SAS Institute Inc. 1985). **see Martin et al.

    glview:description "Allometric equations and chamber-based stem respiration measurements were used to scale wood respiration to the stand scale in five Southern Appalachian mixed Quercus, Liriodendron, and Acer study sites. Sites were located on ridge, midslope, and cove positions at the 250 year-old Joyce Kilmer Memorial old growth forest in western North Carolina. In addition, cove sites that were 18 and 90 years old at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory were also measured using the same bi-monthly sampling schedule over a two-year period. To scale measurements from the chamber to the tree level, allometric equations for ten species (87 trees total) over a diameter range of 3 to 63 cm were developed at Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in western North Carolina during the 1997 growing season. Combined species regressions for total tree sapwood volume and stem surface area versus stem diameter exhibited correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.909 and 0.960, respectively. These two scalars, along with predicted stem temperature from four western North Carolina study sites, explained more than 86% of the observed variation in stem respiration across all five diverse sites. Respiration was scaled from the tree- to the stand-level using 0.15 ha vegetation surveys from each study site where tree species and diameter were recorded. For trees larger than the 63 cm diameter of our developed allometric relationships, we used the predicted sapwood volume and stem surface area of our harvested trees from Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, knowing that the large Liriodendron tulipifera and Quercus prinus trees (> 100 cm diameter) at Joyce Kilmer Memorial old growth forest may not be accurately predicted from our stem surface area and stem volume equations. In addition, trees that were larger than our observed diameter range were cored near our stem respiration chamber to compare sapwood depth with that predicted from stem cross sections of smaller harvested trees. Overall, slope position appears to have little effect on total wood respiration since the greatest stem temperature differences between sites occur in the winter when respiration rates are lowest. Respiration appears to be greater in the old growth cove compared to 18 and 90-year old cove stands due to higher stand-level sapwood volume, but similar respiration efflux per unit volume of sapwood. Stem respiration was measured with a portable infrared gas analyzer (ADC Model LCA-4) and an automated sampler allowing ten trees to be measured in sequence. The sampling chambers were either large (1 5 x 15 cm) or small (4.3 x 8.1 cm)depending upon tree size. Chambers were attached to sample trees with fast curing silicone caulk. Gas samples were collected for 24 hours from ten trees. Tree sapwood temperature was measured with thermocouples inserted 2 cm deep in the stem sapwood. Gas samplers and thermocouples were controlled by battery operated dataloggers facilitating data collection and entry. Data sampling was conducted bi-monthly from June 1995 to March 1997. Five study sites were sampled (see above). All study sites in the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest are old growth temperate broad-leaved forests that are approximately 230 years old. The watershed 18 plot is approximately 95 years old and the watershed 7 plot is approximately 19 years old." ;

    glview:description "This study was designed to investigate the effects of historic anthropogenic disturbance upon small mammal and terrestrial amphibian populations in cove forest communities of the Pisgah National Forest. Analysis of the data obtained during this study will yield information about the ability of these communities to recover from varying degrees of disturbance over a long period of time. Microhabitat data from each trapping station are also being analyzed to determine which site characteristics are correlated with the occurrence of each species trapped. Information derived from this data will improve the ability of the Forest Service to manage these lands for small mammals and terrestrial amphibians. Three levels of anthropogenic disturbance were identified for this study.  Type I stands were identified as areas used for agriculture or pasture at some period between 1940-1950. Type II stands were harvested for timber in this same time interval. Type III stands are relatively undisturbed and function as a control. Four replicates of each stand type were chosen. A 60-m x 60-m trapping grid was established on each site. Trapping stations were established at 10-m intervals (49 stations per site). All sites were simultaneously live-trapped for rodents during July 1997, using mark-and-recapture methodology. Upon completion of live-trapping, pitfall trapping was begun.

While the Southern Appalachian region as a whole experienced population growth between 1950 and 1990, this is a continuation of a pattern set early in the population history of the region, for example, population growth during the decade of 1820 exceeded 40%. The selection of Macon County is based on its now being identified as the most rapidly changing county in the Blue Ridge as well as the analytical importance of place to understanding human decision-making. Place determines both the particular dimensions of the experience humans are seeking (e.g., view, proximity to services, cost of construction) and serves as the basis for evaluating the long-run effects of land-use scenarios on the structure and function of ecosystems.

    glview:description """The effect of forest fragmentation on cove-forest herbs was studied in the Southern Blue Ridge Province. Patches of mesic forests were sampled with 4 ha study plots. The coverage and density of herb species were greater in large patches (>200 ha) than in small patches (less than 10 ha). Several ant-dispersed species, such as Disporum maculatum and Uvularia grandiflora, were more likely to be absent from small patches than from large patches. Wind-dispersed species, such as ferns and composites, were not affected by patch size and isolation. Small patches had reduced amounts of organic matter in the soil, suggesting that small patches have experienced more disturbance than large patches. Otherwise, there were no other differences in soil characteristics between patch sizes. Mechanisms hypothesized to have affected these populations include (a) disruption of population dynamics due to habitat fragmentation, (b) habitat degradation, and (c) anthropogenic disturbance via land use. Disturbances may have affected herb populations directly by increasing mortality rates and by degrading habitat. These habitat changes were confounded by the small size and isolation of small forest patches. During 01 June - 15 July 1995, 14 4-ha study plots were selected and sampled in forest patches ranging in area from 5 ha to >10,000 ha. The sampling units for this study were the 4-ha plot and 1-ha subplots within the larger study plot. The forests studied were located on both public and private lands in Madison and Buncombe counties of North Carolina. Three of the large forest patches were owned and managed by the USDA Forest Service. To control for coarse- level habitat variation, all plots were located in mesic forests at 600-920 m elevation. Plots located in forest patches less than 25 ha in area were classified as being in small patches (N = 8). Plots in patches >200 ha in area were classified as being in large patches (N = 6). Eight plots were classified as being in small patches, and each of these plots were located a

different patch of forest. The mean SE edge-to-edge distance to the nearest patch was 42(8) m for all patches in the study area. The nearest-patch distance for the small patches containing study plots was not significantly different from this mean. Three of the six large-patch plots were located in separate patches. The three remaining large-patch plots were located in the same forested patch that was >10,000 ha in area (Sites 12-14, Figure 1). The minimum distance between these three plots was >1.5 km, and mesic forest

habitats were discontinuous between these plots. Therefore, these plots were treated as independent samples. Forest patch size was measured to the nearest ha using a land-cover map derived from a 1991 Thematic Mapper image (personal communication, P. Bolstad and H. Pape-University of Minnesota).  The same sized study plot (4 ha) was used to sample both large and small patches. This plot size covered a large percentage of the area of the small patches but only a minor portion of large patches. Nevertheless, keeping plot size constant allowed a more direct comparison of the communities found in the two patch sizes by eliminating the need to correct for species area effects due to different sized plots (Palmer 1991). Moreover, the patch size distribution of this landscape was highly skewed. Ninety-three percent of the patches in this landscape were small (less than 25 ha), and less than 2% were large (>200 ha). In light of the difficulties of comparing the vegetation of entire patches, we chose to consider the vegetation of study plots as the

sampling unit of comparison for this study. By limiting our study to closed-canopy, mesic, deciduous forest, we attempted to control for environmental characteristics that might affect herb populations. We defined mesic forest as a community located on a north-facing or sheltered slope with forest canopy dominants of more than one of the following species:  Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer saccharum, Tilia americana, Aesculus octandra, Carya cordiformis, and Betula lenta. Fagus grandifolia, Quercus rubra, Acer

rubrum were also often present. Extensive stands of Rhododendron maximum and Tsuga canadensis were avoided although small stands of both species were encountered. Only closed- canopy forests with trees >50 cm dbh were sampled. All plots were in second growth forest that had been disturbed before 1945 by logging and/or agriculture. We found no evidence that any of the plots had been cultivated, but woodland grazing has been a common practice in this region (Owsley 1949). A detailed history of disturbance was not available for these patches; nevertheless, we attempted to control for disturbance history in the plot selection process by choosing sites with minimal evidence of recent anthropogenic disturbances. To assess the recent history (within 20 years) of anthropogenic disturbance, land owners were interviewed and physical evidence of disturbance (e.g., fences, stumps, road beds) were noted for each plot. Plots that had experienced recent timber harvest or intensive woodland grazing were rejected. It was impossible to locate plotts in small patches with no evidence of disturbance. Therefore, plots were selected in large patches that roughly matched the level of disturbance observed in small patches. That is, we did not compare plots in small patches with plots in large patches of forest that could be classified as old-growth with minimal human disturbance. Field Sampling The diversity and abundance of vascular plants were measured for each study plot. Each study plot was divided into four 1-ha subplots (four subplots per plot * 14 plots= 56 subplots). For each plot, herb and shrub diversity and abundance were measured using 40 0.5-m2 quadrats. The herb/shrub quadrats were located using a stratified random sampling design with each 1-ha subplot receiving 10 quadrats. Quadrats were located at least 20 m from forest edges; however, our ability to avoid the forest edge was limited in small forest patches.  Only a small fraction of a 5-ha patch was >100 m from an edge. In the herb/shrub quadrats, the number of emergent stems for each species was recorded along with a visual estimate of each species percent coverage within the quadrat. Coverage was estimated for foliage up to two m above the ground surface. The number of stems per quadrat for each species was used as an estimate of density. Soil samples were taken from each 1-ha subplot by collecting mineral soil to a depth of 15 cm. The soil was collected from a point adjacent to each of the 10 herb quadrats and combined to form a composite sample for the subplot. Samples were dried at 70 degrees C for 48 hrs and mailed for testing to the Soil Testing Laboratory of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, Agronomic Division. This laboratory measured aspects of soil chemistry, texture, nutrient availability, and organic matter relevant to agricultural and forestry uses (see Tucker 1996 for soil lab methods). Data Analysis The soil analyses produced 15 measures of soil texture and chemistry for each 1-ha subplot. The covariance structure of these 15 metrics was analyzed using a factor analysis with a principal components solution and varimax rotation (PROC FACTOR, SAS 1989) in order to reduce the 15 soil metrics to five complex soil factors (Johnson and Wichern 1988). Based on the absolute value of the rotated factor loadings, specific soil metrics were associated with each factor. This data reduction effectively removed the covariance structure of the data set, producing uncorrelated factor scores. The factor scores for each subplot were used as independent variables to assess the effects of soil attributes on vegetation. A t-test for two samples with unequal variances was used to

determine whether soils differed between plots located in large versus small patches (SAS 1989). Seventeen herb specie</field> 1) were selected as representative of cove-forest communities based on published descriptions of their habitat (e.g., Radford et al. 1968, Weakley 1995). For each species studied, the coverage and density estimates were summed for each 1-ha subplot to reduce the number of zero counts. Then, the coverage sums were arcsin-square root transformed and the density sums were square-root transformed to increase normality of the data (Sokal and Rohlf 1995). These values represent the coverage and abundance of herb species for each 1-ha subplot, the same scale as the soil measurements.""" ;

    glview:description """Forest cover in many southern Appalachian watersheds has increased since the early 1900s due to changing patterns of land use. Changing economics led to the abandonment of pastures and croplands on sites with steep slopes and less-fertile soils. Since 1950 land cover on many sites has changed from nonforest to forest, resulting in greater coverage and less fragmentation of forest habitats. We hypothesized that sites with younger, aggrading forests may not yet support many of the plant species present in older forests. Therefore, we compared the diversity and abundance of vascular plants at two types of presently forested sites: (a) sites with forest established pre-1950 and (b) sites with forest established after 1950. We found that species richness for both woody and herbaceous plants was lower at sites with post-1950 forests. Species with limited dispersal capabilities or specialized habitat needs were absent from these sites. Generalist species were frequently present in these young forests but in lower densities. Many exotic, weedy species persisted in post-1950 forests. Differences between the two types of forests were mitigated by topographic factors, proximity to older forests, and land use history. Paired study plots were selected using maps of forest cover in 1950 and 1990 provided by Paul Bolstad. Each pair of plots had one member in a pre-1950 forest stand and one member in a post 1950 forest stand. Plots were located as to minimize topographic and edaphic differences between the two members of the pair. Twenty-four pairs of plots were sampled in June 1997. Study

plots were 0.10 ha in area. The diversity and abundance of forest herb and shrub species were recorded in nine 0.5 m2 quadrats. The percent coverage (of the ground) was visually estimated for each species in each quadrat. All trees occurring in a 20 x 20 m area within the plot were recorded. Diameter at breast height (dbh) was recorded for individuals >10 cm dbh.""" ;

    glview:description """The effects of disturbance, terrain shape, and soil chemistry on the diversity and abundance of cove forest herbs was studied in mesic forests. Herb communities were sampled using 250-400 m transects. These transects were placed in (a) highly disturbed, small patches of forest; (b) highly disturbed, large patches; and (c) relatively undisturbed, large patches. Herb diversity/abundance, terrain shape, and soil chemistry was sampled at a 10-m resolution. Species richness was greatest in the least disturbed sites in large patches. Disturbance negatively affected the coverage of old-growth indicator species, lilies, and mesophytic species. Differences in patch size, given the same level of disturbance, did not significantly affect the coverage of old-growth indicators and mesophytic species. Weedy species were most abundant in small patches. Disturbance had no significant effect on these weedy species in large patches. The abiotic factors having the greatest influence on coverage of cove and mesophytic species were: soil humic matter and soil pH. Terrain shape, soil cations, P and Ca were correlated with soil humic matter and pH. Herbaceous communities were sampled at sites have three levels of disturbance: low (no evidence of past disturbance or logged >1920), moderate (logged >1 time since 1870), high (previous agricultural use, woodland grazing and/or logging). There were 3, 6, and 4 sites at the low, moderate, and high disturbance levels, respectively. Each site was sampled using transect 250-400 m long, sampled every 2 m using a 0.5 m2 quadrat. In each quadrat, the count and percent coverage was recorded for each species.  During analysis, five quadrats along a 10-m sections of the transects were summed. This 10-m data corresponds to the scale of soil and terrain shape

measurements. Every 10 m along the transect, a soil sample was taken and a measure of terrain shape was calculated. The soil was taken from the top 10cm of soil (A horizon).  These samples were analyzed for soil humic matter and chemical properties. Terrain shape was assessed by measuring the slope at eight points located 50 m from the transect at the cardinal and subcardinal directions. The sum of this slope provides an index of terrain shape (i.e., >0=concave terrain, less than 0=convex).""" ;

    glview:description "We investigated the role of a flood in particulate organic matter (POM) dynamics of the Little Tennessee river/floodplain ecosystem in western North Carolina, USA. We measured litterfall, leaf breakdown, and floodplain litter at 12 sites. Annual litterfall (274-625 g m-2 y-1) was typical of a temperate deciduous forest but lower than lowland floodplain forests in the eastern United States. Leaf breakdown rates of 4 tree species ranged from 0.001-0.010 d-1. Following a flood on 8 January 1998, the 12 sites were separated into 3 classes of inundation: inundated, partially-inundated, and non-inundated. Sites inundated by the flood had significantly less floodplain leaf litter and large woody material after the flood. There was no significant change at the partially-inundated or non-inundated sites. In addition, there was no significant difference in herbaceous litter between pre- and post-flood collections at any site. The flood also increased leaf breakdown rates of red maple (Acer rubrum) and black walnut (Juglans nigra) but had no effect on American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana) or sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). Our measurements of litterfall, leaf breakdown, and floodplain litter suggest that flood entrainment of POM from the floodplain of Little Tennessee River is a source of POM to the active channel. However, floodplain POM inputs were a small annual source of POM for the river compared to direct litterfall. Litter inputs to the floodplain | Ten litter traps were placed at each of the 12 sites at 2-m intervals along a transect parallel to the river channel located approximately 2 m from the river bank. Litter traps consisted of a 0.25-m2 frame fitted with 1-mm mesh fiberglass screen and supported by three wooden stakes. Litter was removed from the traps twice monthly during times of peak leaffall (October-November) and monthly at other times from September 1997 until September 1998.  Litter was dried (50 degrees C, 2 d) and separated into leaves, wood, and miscellaneous litter (e.g., flowers, seeds). Leaves were sorted to species, weighed, recombined, ground, and subsampled. Wood and miscellaneous litter were separately weighed, ground, and subsampled. Subsamples were weighed, ashed (550 degrees C, 45 min), and reweighed to determine ash free dry mass (AFDM). | Leaf breakdown | Fifteen leaf bags of the 2 most common floodplain species, sycamore and American hornbeam, were placed on the floodplain at 8 of the 12 sites, and 15 leaf bags of 2 other common floodplain species, red maple and black walnut, were placed at 3 sites. Leaf bags of a given species were placed at sites where that species was common. Each leaf bag initially contained 8 g of leaf material. Three bags of American hornbeam, black walnut, and red maple were retrieved after 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 mo at each site, and 3 leaf bags of sycamore were collected after 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9 mo at each site. All leaves were washed, dried, weighed, ground, and subsampled. Subsamples were weighed, ashed, and reweighed to determine AFDM. Species-specific exponential rates of breakdown were determined from the negative slope of the log percentage AFDM remaining (y-axis) vs. the days of exposure (x-axis) (e.g. Benfield 1996).  | Floodplain litter standing crop | Floodplain litter standing crop (FPL) was measured by removing all coarse litter from 20 0.05-m2 plots at each site (240 total plots) in December 1997 (pre-flood) and January 1998 (post-flood). Litter was dried and separated into leaves, wood, and herbaceous material. Sorted materials were then weighed, ground, and subsampled to determine AFDM." ;

    glview:description """Aquatic ecosystems in medium sized watersheds (10-40 sq. km) in the southern Blue Ridge tend to have low productivity due to low light, low temperature, high gradient, and low nutrient levels. Human activities can alter each of these important drivers of ecosystem structure. Historic land use carries important implications for present and future biological and physical conditions. We assessed current conditions at sites whose watersheds were in (1) reference conditions, (2) forested land use, and (3) agricultural land use. The latter are projected to move toward second home development and suburban land uses, respectively. This study will document watershed land cover and land use as well as in-stream biological and physical changes as they are projected to occur over a 20-year period. Land use projections were derived from regression models base on past and present land cover and terrain information. Hazard Site Sampling Protocol and Methods || Sediment cores | Sediment core samples were collected at each site using a 60 cm (height) x 25 cm (diameter) stainless steel stovepipe corer. Sediment cores were located haphazardly in three riffles and three pools at each site. The coring device was inserted approximately 10 cm into the streambed. All substrate was removed to a depth of 10 cm. Large substrate (> 64 mm) was removed first and weighed in the field. All remaining substrate was removed, placed in plastic bags and transported to a lab at UGA for processing. Samples were dried in the lab at 105?C for three weeks, or until completely dry. Samples were then sieved into three size fractions: gravel (2 64 mm), sand (0.063 2 

mm) and silt-clay (< 0.063 mm). Size fractions were then weighed to the nearest 0.1 

gram. Percent fines (< 2 mm) and percent coarse material (> 2 mm) were determined 

using sediment core data. || TSS | Total suspended solids (TSS) samples were collected at baseflow at each site. Three 125 ml water samples, to be used for determining water chemistry, were collected from the thalweg of run habitat. Using a hand pump, water samples were filtered in the field onto a pre-ashed, pre-weighed 47 mm, 0.45 m Whatman glass fiber filter. Filters were placed in aluminium envelopes, transported to the lab, dried in a 105 C oven for 24 hours and weighed. Water sample filtrate was placed on ice and transported to lab for water chemistry analysis. || Pebble Count | Pebble counts were conducted to determine the particle size distribution of the bed substrate. One hundred particles were picked up and measured while traversing a zig-zag pattern at each site. Particles were measured in riffle-run habitat, while pool habitat was avoided. This affords direct comparison of similar habitat among sites. Medial axes of particles were measured to the nearest millimeter. Measurements were then converted to phi size (i.e. the negative log, base two), and average phi was determined. Some studies have suggested average phi as a good predictor of fish and macroinvertebrate measures (pers. comm., D. Walters, University of Georgia). || Temperature | Stream temperature data was collected in late summer 2000, from August 3rd to September 15th. Temperature was measured every 2 hours during this period, using a Hobo data logger contained in a waterproof PVC housing. Mean temperature and daily temperature flux were determined for each site.  || Algae Standing Stock | Benthic algal biomass samples were collected at each site using a custom made suction apparatus. The apparatus consisted of a 20 cm long plexiglass cylinder with a 4.3 cm diameter. A rubber gasket was fitted to the end of the sampler which was pressed against the substrate to ensure a water tight seal between the sampler and substrate. Inside the sampler was a round scrub-brush, which was used to dislodge the algae from the substrate. Three algae samples were collected haphazardly and composited at each of 10 evenly spaced transects per site. Composite samples were placed on ice and transported to lab for processing. Algae samples were sub-sampled for determination of chlorophyll a concentration, ash-free dry mass and species identification. Chlorophll a concentration was determined from sub-samples using standard pigment analysis methods (Wetzel and Likens 1991). Pigments were extracted using 90% acetone buffered with ammonium hydroxide. Chlorophyll a was measured using standard fluorometric methods.Ash-free dry mass (AFDM) was also measured. Sub-samples were filtered through pre-weighed 47 mm, 0.45 ?m Whatman? glass fiber filters. Filters were then dried in a 105 C oven for 24 hours and weighed. || Fish | Fish were collected between April 16th and July 6th 2000 using a backpack  electroshocker, seines and dip nets. At each site a quantitative sample was taken during one thorough pass within a representative 50 m reach. To ensure comparable catch per unit effort, aan attempt was made to equalize electroshocking time per area sampled. After each quantitative collection, a larger area was randomly searched to determine community species richness. One individual from each species (except the federally threatened Cyprinella (Erimonax) monacha) was kept for museum specimens. Remaining fish were identified in the field, counted, and returned to the stream. || Energy Grade Line and Channel Cross Section Surveys | Standard survey techniques were used to survey three channel cross sections along the 100m study reach at each site. Energy grade line was also recorded by measuring water depth in the thalweg and channel elevation along the 100m reach. Pools and riffles were noted to allow calculation of pool to pool and riffle to riffle gradients. Point bar elevations were recorded separately, as were elevations of the flood plain. || Benthic Macroinvertebrates | Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected in riffle habitat by disturbing substrate inside a 0.4-sq. meter frame to a depth of 10 cm for 2 minutes.  Material was collected in a net (353 micron mesh) held downstream of the

sampling area and fixed in 3% formalin. Samples were rinsed in the laboratory in a 125 micron sieve and preserved in 80% ethanol.  Macroinvertebrates were separated from other materials (sand, detritus) and identified to genus.""" ;

    glview:description "1. Rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is a common evergreen shrub in riparian areas of the southern Appalachians, where its leaves can comprise a large proportion of leaf litter in streams. However, they are relatively refractory and generally considered a low quality food resource for detritivores. | 2. Our objective was to assess whether macroconsumers (primarily crayfish (Cambarus bartonii)) influence rhododendron leaf breakdown in a forested southern Appalachian stream in both summer (when leaves other than rhododendron are relatively scarce) and autumn (when other leaves are relatively abundant). We conducted two leaf decay experiments, one in summer and one in autumn, using pre-conditioned leaves. Macroconsumers were excluded from the benthos of a fourth-order stream using electric fences; we predicted that excluding macroconsumers would reduce the decay rate of rhododendron leaves in both summer and autumn. | 3. In both experiments, breakdown rate was lower in exclusion treatments. Macroconsumers accounted for approximately 33% and 54% of rhododendron decay in summer and autumn, respectively. We attribute this effect to direct shredding of rhododendron by crayfish. Biomass of insect shredders, insect predators and fungi did not differ between control and exclusion treatments, indicating that insectivorous sculpins (Cottus bairdi) had no effect on rhododendron decay and that omnivorous crayfish did not exert an indirect effect via alteration of insect or fungal biomass. | 4. The influence of shredding insects varied between summer and autumn. In summer, when other, more palatable leaf types were not available, rhododendron leaf packs appeared to provide resource islands for insect shredders. There was a significant inverse relationship between insect shredders and leaf pack mass in the summer exclusion treatment: insects were the only organisms eating leaves in this treatment and, as shredder biomass increased, remaining leaf pack mass decreased. In the control treatment, however, we did not see this relationship; here, the effect of insect shredders was presumably swamped by the impact of crayfish. In autumn, when other leaves were abundant, insect shredder biomass in rhododendron leaf packs was less than one-third of summer values. | 5. Even at low density (approximately 2 m-2) crayfish were able to influence an ecosystem process such as leaf decay in both summer and autumn. Given the threatened status of many crayfish species in the United States, this finding is especially relevant. Even small alterations in crayfish assemblages, whether via loss of native species and/or introduction of exotic species, may have significant repercussions for ecosystem function. We conducted two electric exclusion experiments, one from 16/7/99 - 29/8/99 (Summer experiment) and the other from 3/10/99 to 28/11/99 (Autumn experiment). Pre-conditioned rhododendron leaf packs (i.e., incubated in stream for ~ 2 mos. prior to experiment) were placed in 0.25 m^2 PVC frames lined with copper wire (total = 10 frames, arranged in 5 pairs, for each experiment). Electric fence chargers were connected to one frame in each pair; this electric current prevented macroconsumers (i.e., fishes and crayfishes) from entering the area. We then examined how macroconsumer access (i.e., control) and exclusion (i.e., electrified) treatments differed in terms of insects colonizing leaf packs, fungal biomass on leaf packs, and leaf breakdown throughout each experiment. At the beginning of each experiment we also collected leaves from 10 1 m wide transects across the stream, to assess availability of rhododendron versus non-rhododendron leaves." ;

    glview:description """Anthropogenic sedimentation poses a significant threat to stream ecosystems throughout the world. Increases in bedload (sediment transported and deposited on the stream bottom) can be especially detrimental for benthic communities. To examine how increased bedload directly and indirectly affects stream communities, we simultaneously manipulated sediment and top-down effects of macroconsumers (fishes and crayfish) in situ in two factorial experiments, one using tiles and one using leaf packs as sampling substrates. Bedload was increased by adding small amounts of sediment (2.5 x normal levels) to localized areas (0.25 m2) of an otherwise unimpacted stream. This increase in bedload had direct effects on basal resources in both the tile and leaf pack experiments. In the tile experiment algal composition was altered by sediment addition, while in the leaf pack experiment fungal biomass declined with sediment. The only direct effect of sediment on insect assemblages occurred in the leaf pack experiment, where sediment reduced predatory stonefly (Plecoptera) and Atherix (Diptera) biomass. However, sediment addition significantly altered top-down effects of macroconsumers in both experiments. In the tile experiment, macroconsumer reductions of total insect biomass, hydropsychid (Trichoptera) biomass, and predatory stonefly biomass were eliminated when sediment was added. The only impact of macroconsumers that was not eliminated in sediment treatments was their reduction of chironomid (Diptera) biomass. Increased bedload did not have as great an impact on top-down effects in the leaf pack experiment, although macroconsumer reductions of tanypodid (Diptera) abundance and biomass were eliminated in sediment treatments. These experiments show that small, environmentally realistic increases in bedload can directly and indirectly affect biota in both algal and detrital-based food webs. While indirect impacts of sedimentation have been examined less frequently than direct biotic responses, this study demonstrates that alteration of top-down impacts can be an important effect of increased sedimentation. In these experiments, small amounts of sediment were added to localized areas of an otherwise unimpacted stream. Even these relatively small-scale increases had significant impacts on stream communities, suggesting that the influence of larger scale sedimentation will be even greater.

Study_Dataset_Keywords: bedload, Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, electric exclusion, indirect effects, macroconsumers, predator-prey, sedimentation, species interactions, stream, top-down We conducted two electric exclusion experiments. One experiment used ceramic tiles as sampling substrates, and was conducted from 7/29/97 to 9/8/97. The other experiment used sugar maple leaf packs as sampling substrates, and was conducted from 10/9/99 to 12/4/99. In each experiment, sampling substrates were secured in 0.25 m^2 PVC frames; ten pairs of these frames were placed in the given reach. One frame in each pair was hooked to an electric fence charger. This electric charge excluded macroconsumers (i.e., fishes and crayfishes) from these areas, creating ten replicate pairs of control (or access) and electrified (or exclusion) frames (this was true for both the tile experiment and the leaf pack experiment). In each experiment, five pairs served as sediment controls (i.e., ambient sediment conditions). The remaining five pairs served as sediment addition treatments, with each frame receiving daily additions of 250 g of sand. In each experiment, we thus had four treatments: ambient sediment/macroconsumer access, ambient sediment/macroconsumer exclusion, sediment addition/macroconsumer access, sediment addition/macroconsumer exclusion. In the tile experiment, we examined insect abundance and biomass, chlorophyll a concentration, AFDM, inorganic sediment, and algal abundance and biomass across treatments. In the leaf pack experiment, we examined leaf breakdown, fungal biomass, and insect abundance and biomass across treatments.""" ;

    glview:description "Spatial and temporal variability of consumer-controlled forces have been the subject of much debate in ecology. To date, most studies considering variability of these top-down interactions have focused on systems minimally impacted by human activities. However, human modification of the landscape is prevalent, and it can significantly affect the strength and outcome of species interactions. The objective of this study was to examine how top-down interactions vary among streams with differing amounts of human disturbance in their watersheds. To address this issue, we experimentally excluded macroconsumers (fishes and crayfishes) from benthic areas of five southern Appalachian streams. These sites represented a range of human watershed development, from 100% to less than 50% forested; macroconsumer assemblages at low development sites were dominated by benthic insectivores (Cottus bairdi) and crayfishes, whereas algivores (Campostoma anomalum) and general insectivores (e.g., Notropis leuciodus) were common at more developed sites. Using ceramic tiles as sampling substrates, we compared sediment, algal assemblages (chlorophyll a, AFDM, abundance, biovolume, and composition), and insect assemblages (abundance, biomass, and composition) in macroconsumer exclusion and control areas. In general, water chemistry variables (e.g., nutrient concentrations, conductivity, total suspended solids, and temperature) increased from low to high development sites. Significant cross-site differences were found for every response variable, but macroconsumer exclusion often had relatively similar effects among all sites. Response of chlorophyll a and AFDM to exclusion varied across sites, but at most sites there was a tendency for concentrations to be greater in the absence of macroconsumers. Macroconsumer exclusion did not have a significant effect on total algal abundance or biovolume across all sites, but exclusion did influence algal composition. Adnate diatom taxa (e.g., Achnanthes spp.) comprised a significantly greater proportion of total biovolume in controls, whereas upright diatom taxa (e.g., Melosira varians, Cymbella spp.) were more dominant in exclusion treatments. Insect abundance and biomass were greater in exclusion versus control treatments at all sites, indicating that macroconsumers had a negative effect on insect assemblages. These results indicate that top-down effects were not diminished by increasing watershed development. Macroconsumers significantly affected benthic communities at all five sites, despite cross-site differences in physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Although certain effects of watershed disturbance may tend to decrease the strength of top-down interactions (e.g., increased sedimentation or shifts in macroconsumer assemblages), these reductions may be offset by other concurrent changes (e.g., increased light and nutrient availability). We conducted 40-day electric exclusion experiments at each of 5 sites. At each site, five pairs of 0.25 m^2 PVC frames were placed in the stream. One frame in each pair was attached to an electric fence charger; this charger delivered electric pulses to the benthic area, preventing macroconsumers (fishes and crayfishes) from entering. Thus, in each stream we had five replicate pairs of macroconsumer access (i.e., control) and macroconsumer exclusion (i.e., electrified) treatments. Ceramic tiles were tethered in each frame; one tile was removed every 5 days between days 15 and 40. Once removed, tiles were scraped and brushed to remove insects, algae and sediments. Insects were live-picked, identified and measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. Subsamples were taken to determine algal composition, chlorophyll a concentration, AFDM, and inorganic sediment mass." ;

    glview:description "Changes in aboveground and forest floor mass, carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) pools were quantified on three sites in the southern Appalachians 2 yr after felling and burning. Before felling and burning, stands were characterized by sparse overstories and dense Kalmia latifolia L. understories. Two years after burning, foliar C and N pools had reached 25% and 29% of pretreatment levels, respectively. Foliar N concentrations were not different from pretreatment values. Standing wood C and N pools were 1% and 2%, respectively, of pretreatment values. Wood N concentrations were significantly higher on two sites, likely related to differences in fire intensity. Forest floor N content 2 yr after burning was 90% of pretreatment levels, most contained in unconsumed large woody material. Forest floor mass was significantly lower in the Oi layer and unchanged in the Oe + Oa layers. Forest floor N concentrations were generally lower after treatment. The site with the least intense fire and the lowest mass loss from the forest floor had the highest forest floor, foliage, and wood N concentrations 2 yr after burning. Site recovery after felling and burning was a function of fire severity and the capacity for site-nutrient retention through plant uptake. Study sites were felled in the summer of 1990, and burned in September of 1990. On the 1 x 1 m plots used to determine foliage biomass, a random 0.30 x 0.30 meter sample of the forest floor was taken. Samples were separated into L and F which was subjectively defined as loose (i.e., could be swept across the surface with moderate effort) and identifiable organic matter, and \"H\", which was composed of un-identifiable organic matter intermixed with the root mat. Samples were dried at 70 C for at least three days and weighed.  Forest floor was re-sampled using four 0.30 x 0.30 meter plots located 1 meter to the left of the pre-burn sample plot. Where possible, LandF and H were separated. However, in most cases, the fires consumed (or transformed) the LandF layer, leaving the ashed from the LandF mixed with the H layer. Samples were dried and weighed as before. 9and10/90. Forest floor was re-sampled following the same procedures on 4/9 and 4/11/91. Except in a few cases, it was impossible to differentiate LandF and H during this sampling. Hence, only a composite sample was taken." ;

Amounts of aboveground vegetation and forest floor mass, nitrogen (N), and carbon (C) were measured before and after treatment by sampling wood, foliage, herbs and grasses, and forest floor (Oi and Oe+Oa layers). Burning decreased woody mass by 48 to 60% across the three sites. Significant losses of mass, N, and C occurred in the Oi layer, but not in the Oe + Oa layer. Total aboveground N losses across sites ranged from 193 to 480 kg ha_-1_. These losses may be significant because N availability is low on these sites. Variations in patterns of mass, N, and C consumption were related to differences in amounts, types, size distributions, and moisture contents of fuels. All vegetation greater than 10.2 cm DBH was measured on each 15 x 33 meter plot with a DBH tape. Measurements were made in winter 1989. DBH measurements were converted to total tree woody biomass using the general allometric equation of Clark and Schroeder (1986)." ;

    glview:description "Past disturbances are important to understanding today�s forest composition, structure, and function, as well as reactions to current stress and disturbance. Unfortunately, history is often not known at the stand level. The purpose of this study is to characterize the stand dynamics and disturbance history of the oak slopes in the Coweeta Basin, a long-term ecological research station located in the southern Appalachian mountains. The basin has a history logging in the early 1900�s, but remnant old-growth trees remain in the forest. Joyce Kilmer Wilderness area, a wilderness reserve in the same physiographic province as Coweeta, is an old-growth forest with no known logging. It is unknown if remnant old-growth trees provide the same record of disturbance as old-growth trees located in more undisturbed stands. Elliott et al. (1999) described vegetation differences with changes in topography and moisture at Coweeta, but it is unclear whether these changes correspond to different disturbance histories along those gradients. My specific objectives are to determine the disturbance history of seven stands in the Coweeta basin, determine if stands along topographic or compositional gradients in Coweeta have different disturbance histories (e.g. frequency, intensity and origin), establish the disturbance history in two old-growth stands in Joyce Kilmer Wilderness and compare the similarities and differences of the stands in Coweeta and Joyce Kilmer. Stand selection was based on preliminary dating of several large trees per stand, species composition and history. Prism sampling (2.0 BAF, metric) was done at five to ten points in each stand to characterize stand composition and structure. Sixty to 80 increment cores per stand were taken to the pith at 1 meter from the ground parallel to topographic contours to reduce effects of tension wood. Cores were stored in straws until transported to the lab. In the lab, cores were air dried, mounted, and sanded using progressively finer sandpaper in preparation for analysis. Once prepared, cores will be examined and ring widths measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a dissecting microscope, Velmex sliding stage and J2X software. Cores will be visually cross-dated within species and stands using marker years and then checked with the computer cross-dating program COFECHA. Stand characteristics, such as age structure and species distribution, will be evaluated and compared. Disturbance chronologies will be created and compared for each stand and species using multivariate analysis and Mantel tests. Ring widths and disturbance chronologies are expected to reveal past disturbances in the stands. A disturbance is detected by large, abrupt and sustained releases in the ring widths, as well as well-defined cohorts. By comparing the chronologies, inferences can be made regarding the effect of topographic and compositional gradients on disturbance history." ;

                (circa 1992) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various
                ancillary data (where available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite
                imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up
                to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for
                'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a
                spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below)
                correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the
                reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-State level. The
                statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution
                Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to
                see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for
                larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the
                NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The New Hampshire portion of the NLCD
                was created as part of land cover mapping activities for Federal Region I that
                includes the States of Connecticut, Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and
                Massachusetts. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories
                with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative
                effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental
                Protection Agency (USEPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the
                conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by
                the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is
                a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data. Partners
                include the USGS (National Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water Resources
                Divisions), USEPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                Administration. The original NLCD grid was projected into UTM Zone 19 and was
                clipped to a box surrounding the USDA Forest Service, Hubbard Brook Experimental
                Forest.""" ;

                was extracted on November 10, 1999. Some of the data that had been entered into SOC
                was outdated, and some national forest boundaries had never been entered for a
                variety of reasons. The USDA Forest Service, Geospatial Service and Technology
                Center has edited this data in places where it was questionable or missing, to match

The data from each census of the LFDP will be updated at intervals as each survey of the LFDP shows errors in the previous data collection.  After posting on the web, researchers who are not part of the project are then welcome to use the data. Given the enormous amount of time, effort and resources required to manage the LFDP, obtain these data, and ensure data accuracy, LFDP Principal Investigators request that researchers intending to use this data comply with the requests below.

    glview:description "We evaluated the influences of leaf quality, climate and microsite on the decomposition of leaves of five tropical tree species. Single-species litterbags were used to determine weight loss during the first three months of decomposition in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Significant differences were found in decomposition rates among leaf species (Inga fagifolia < I. vera < Manilkara bidentata < C-roton poecilanthus << Sapium laurocerasus), but only S. laurocerasus differed significantly from the other species. Lignin had a suggestive negative correlation with leaf decomposition while carbon content and the lignin:N ratio were significantly correlated with mass loss. Content of N, P, Ca, and polyphenol were not significantly correlated with mass loss, but several of the litter quality variables were correlated with each other. Leaf species decomposed faster under canopies of their source trees than in a common plot where the source species were absent. Decomposition in two species in the Euphorbiaceae, S. laurocerasus and C. poecilanthus, was significantly affected by microsite. Leaching losses during the first three weeks were greater under source trees than in the common plot, and may have been associated with differences in canopy structure and throughfall. Differences in detrital communities, however, could have contributed to the differences in decomposition between microsites. Leaves of all species decomposed significantly faster in the wet than in the dry period (P = 0.001) despite little climatic variation in this subtropical wet forest type. This suggests that decomposition of tropical leaf litter might be sensitive to microclimatic changes on the forest floor resulting from either global climate change, or from natural or anthropogenic disturbances that open the canopy." ;

    glview:description "Using automated overwinter sampling devices, we collected preserved phytoplankton samples from multiple depths in Lake Fryxell, a permanently ice-covered lake in southern Victoria Land, Antarctica. Photosynthetic algae were maintained in a stable water column throughout winter darkness. The algal taxa overwintered in different ways in a species-specific manner. Typical vegetative cells were the most abundant form for all species found in the water column. Populations of one chlorophyte, Stichococcus sp., were observed in winter, but the species was absent in both summers. Two cryptophyte species were more abundant in winter than in summer. We interpret the increase in algal population size as evidence of heterotrophic growth in winter and of mixotrophic behavior throughout the year. For two chlorophyte species, some portion of the population had a distinctive morphology, for example, many Chlamydomonas subcaudata Wille. formed akinetes, whereas many Chlorella sp. contained a large amount of starch or other storage material. During winter, vegetative cells of the most abundant cyanobacterial species, Phormidium angustissimum West et West, occurred at the depth of the summer maximum and at depths below the oxycline. The presence of P. angustissimum below the oxycline may have resulted from the accumulation of settling cells at a depth with a greater density. In contrast to the settling of P. angustissimum, the general absence of the other algal species below the oxycline in winter indicated that these species were not influenced by overwinter settling." ;

    glview:description """Branching corals, like many in the genus Acropora, provide structurally complex habitats
        for reef fishes and other organisms. Fluctuations in the abundance, distribution and
        characteristics of staghorn Acroporid corals may contribute to changes in the abundance and
        species composition of reef fishes due to changes in the availability of shelter habitat and
        food. Farming damselfishes of the genus Stegastes occur in high abundances in staghorn
        thickets and actively defend food and nest space against organisms that threaten these
        resources. Here I examine the value of staghorn thickets as habitat for fishes, and how the
        presence of territorial farming damselfishes may influence the assemblage of fishes that
        associate with staghorn corals. Surveys of 185 Acropora pulchra thickets located in the
        lagoons surrounding the island of Moorea, French Polynesia revealed 85 species of fish from
        25 families. Total fish abundance and species richness values ranged from no fish on a
        thicket to a high of 275 individuals and 26 species. Thicket area was the most important
        characteristic in explaining variation in attributes of the fish assemblage among staghorn
        thickets, with other characteristics explaining little of the species composition or trophic
        structure. Behavioral observations revealed that farming damselfishes were most aggressive
        toward corallivores, herbivores, and egg predators, while they ignored most carnivores and
        omnivores. Despite this pattern, I observed positive covariance between Stegastes and the
        group of fishes that elicited the strongest aggressive response when the effect of thicket
        area was removed, suggesting these fishes remain drawn to the resources produced or enhanced
        by Stegastes on A. pulchra thickets.""" ;

    glview:description "Previous work has shown that passage of Englemann spruce (Picea Englemanii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tree islands across tundra lowers the soil carbon and nitrogen storage capacity of the top 15cm of soil (A horizon) (Pauker and Seastedt 1996). This data forms part of a study which seeks to further examine how changes in  carbon storage capacity are associated with changes in soil physical properties. Soils were collected in 1994. We sought to determine whether there were changes in natural abundance of C and N isotopes associated with previously reported changes in C and N content. Any such changes in natural abundance of C and N isotopes may indicate differences in inputs to the ecosystem or differences in ecosystem processes that may account for the differences in N and C content that have been observed. In addition to measuring ratios of natural isotopes  of C and N, we also measured C and N contents to provide a comparison with  previous studies. In order to convert % N and C values to Kgs of N and C  per m2 we used bulk density values, meaned across sampling dates, that had  been previously measured for these sites (these raw data are available at: http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?krmslblk.ts).  When N and C soil contents were considered on a percentage basis, levels  at windward sites were significantly lower than those of undisturbed tundra,  but levels directly beneath krummholsz were not significantly different from tundra soils. Bulk density was significantly lower under krummholz  than other sites. Thus when N and C amounts were expressed on a volume  (Kg m2, to a depth of 15cm) , they were significantly lower in both  krummholz and windward sites than in undisturbed tundra. D13C values  of soils under krummholz were significantly less negative under krummholz  than from windward or undisturbed tundra sites. A less negative d13C value is indicative of less discrimination and may be attributable to either vegetation differences or differences in decomposition rates.  D13C signatures of krummholz and tundra vegetation were also examined and are available at: http://culter.colorado.edu/exec/.extracttoolA?krmslrts.ts" ;

    glview:description "Previous work has shown that passage of Englemann spruce (Picea Englemanii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) tree islands across tundra lowers the soil carbon and nitrogen storage capacity of the top 15cm of soil (A horizon) (Pauker and Seastedt 1996). This study shows that levels of KCl extractable ammonium and percent organic matter were also significantly higher in the A horizon of undisturbed tundra sites compared with soils underneath or immediately adjacent to (windward or leeward) the krummholz. The response of soil KCl extractable NO3- also showed this trend but was not statistically significant. Holtmeir and Broll (1992) suggested that the depletion of organics and nutrients following the passage of tree island may be associated with a reduced clay content. We analyzed a subsample of these soils for cation exchange capacity (CEC) and texture. We did not  find significantly lower clay content in soils under or adjacent to  krummholz compared with those from undisturbed tundra. In fact, percent  clay was greater in krummholz and windward sites than in tundra sites.  The percent clay of windward sites was significantly greater in windward  soils than either krummholz or tundra soils. Clearly, depletion of organics  following the passage of tree islands does not appear to be associated with  a depleted clay content. We found that CEC was very highly significantly correlated with percent organic content (using percent organic data only  from the subset of soils on which CEC was measured). Therefore, the CEC  content of these soils would appear to be strongly associated with the  organic content but not with the clay content. Percent soil moisture was  significantly higher directly underneath the krummholz compared with the  other sites. There was no effect of treatment on pH. We also investigated whether the organic matter lost in association with krummholz colonization  (i.e. 1m from the tree) was replenished as tundra vegetation recolonized  in the wake of the tree island. In order to do this we compared soils from  tundra sites in the wake of the tree islands (5m or 10m windward of the  tree -a distance that represents approximately 250 and 500 years since  krummholz colonization) with soils from undisturbed tundra sites. We found  no significant difference in organic matter contents along the windward  transect, indicating that recovery of organic matter content following colonization by krummholz is an extremely sow process. The soil samples were collected on 7 sampling dates in the summers of 1995 and 1996 and all the variables are listed by their separate sampling dates in this file." ;

    glview:description "Bowman et al. (1993) have demonstrated that alpine tundra is  sensitive to nitrogen and phosphorus additions. Changes in productivity  and species composition (belatedly) follow chronic fertilization. Exactly  how this response is mediated by changes in precipitation is unknown but  can be addressed using the snowfence experiment. Moreover, replication of  the experiment will allow for additional sampling of biotic and abiotic  components and processes not possible with the size of the Bowman plots.  In 1993, 64 2X2m plots were placed in dry and mesic sites both within and  outside of the snowfence area, so that 4 replicates of each treatment  (nitrogen addition, phosphorus addition, nitrogen and phosphorus addition,  and control) could be established in each meadow type with and without  snowpack augmentation. 16 additional plots were established on a wet meadow  site, but since a corresponding type site did not exist in the snowfence area,  there was no snowpack manipulation for the wet meadow plots. Species present in the northwest corner of each plot were identified periodically." ;

    glview:description "A 300 x 600 m integrated terrain unit map (ITUM) was produced at  1:500 scale inside the 350 x 650 m Martinelli grid, and the 1:500 digital elevation model (DEM). Vegetation was mapped using Komarkova's (1979)  classification system (Braun-Blanquet) units. All map units were mapped to 1g8-inch minimum map-polygon-size resolution. The map is part of the  Martinelli grid geographic information system (GIS). Many GIS projects use  an approach in which existing mapped information is digitized into the GIS  database directly from the original sources. The maps may have different  map scale, map-unit resolutions, dates of data collection, and  classification systems. When these different sources are combined in a  GIS, artifacts may arise due to boundary mismatches and scale  incompatibility (Dangermond and Harnden 1990). Integrated geobotanical  mapping can minimize many of these problems. This method simultaneously  maps vegetation and other terrain features that are interpreted on a  common air-photo base (Everett et al. 1978, Walker et al. 1980). We use  the term geobotany in its traditional European sense to refer to the  study of plant communities and their relationships to geology, landforms,  and soils (Braun-Blanquet 1932). Terrain geomorphic boundaries are used to  guide the delineation on aerial photographs of most major vegetation  boundaries similiar to the landscape-guided vegetation mapping approach  developed in Europe (Zonneveld 1988) and the integrated terrain unit  mapping approach developed by the Environmental System Research Institute  in Redlands, CA (Dangermond and Harnden 1990). Additional information  concerning the Niwot Ridge LTER GIS can be found in Walker et al. (1993)." ;

Solar radiation was recorded on a bimetalic strip mechanical  actinometer. Ninety percent of solar radiation from 360 to 2000 nm was  transmitted through the instrument's glass dome. Wind speed (peak gust)  was measured with a 3-cup, AC-generating anemometer that continuously  recorded onto an Esterline Angus strip chart recorder. Run of wind was  measured with a Belford totalizing cup anenometer with a counter (at a  height of approximately 3 meters above ground).  Average wind speed was  calculated from the peak gust trace. The thermohygrograph and actinometer  both used wind-up or battery-driven clock drives that rotated the  recording chart on a right cylindrical drum with a fixed period  between 24 h and 861 h depending on the gears used.

Intertidal surveys are comprised of four components, all sampled along the same transects: (1) point contact estimates of intertidal cover and substrate characteristics, (2) swath transects to estimate the density of seastars and abalone, (3) quadrat sampling to estimate the density of mobile invertebrates, and (4) topography (elevation relative to mean low low water (mllw)). Intertidal coastal biodiversity surveys are conducted throughout the year at sites ranging from Southeast Alaska to Baja California, Mexico. Selected sites are resampled on a 3-5 year cycle.

    glview:description "This soil moisture study was initiated in 1960 to investigate the effects of patch clearcut logging and slash burning (1962-63) in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in the Oregon Cascade Range.  Since soil moisture and vegetation sampling continued regularly until 1980, this is a unique data set that represents nearly two decades of post-treatment information.  Plant cover exerts a profound influence on soil moisture levels through its effects on interception, infiltration, evaporation, and transpiration.  In the Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest, clearcut logging and slash burning are common practices that can dramatically alter plant cover and soil moisture.  Logging can increase soil moisture by temporarily reducing cover and associated water use, and burning may further augment soil moisture levels by suppressing the survival and regrowth of vegetation.  Indeed, part of the rationale for slash burning in the region is to control shrubs and other vegetation that would otherwise compete with conifer seedlings for available moisture, light, and nutrients.  Within a few years after burning, however, invading vegetation may deplete soil moisture to levels comparable to forested areas.  Such  observations point to the value of long-term information to better understand dynamic soil moisture and plant cover responses to forest practices." ;

A plant community classification system (Dyrness et al., 1971) was used as a primary means of stratification, and a set of permanent vegetation plots (Reference Stands) was installed to represent forest communities with distinct vegetation and hypothesized different environments (Dyrness et al., 1974).  A thermograph network was installed within the reference stands in the early 1970's (Zobel et al., 1974), and vegetation standing crop, tree growth and mortality, and plant succession were also measured.

    glview:description "Landslides are a serious geologic hazard, threatening public safety, natural resources, and infrastructure, and costing millions of dollars for repairs each year in Oregon. This map of areas where rapidly moving landslides pose hazards in western Oregon is part of the State's attempt to protect lives and property. The overview map delineates zones that are prone to landslide hazards, especially rapidly moving landslides. These zones provide information to local governments about property that might require more site-specific evaluation. The map is in digital format and was produced with data at a scale of 1:24,000 (1 in. = 2,000 ft). Creation of the map involved the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling, checking and calibrating with limited field evaluations, and comparing with historic landslide inventories. The extent and severity of the hazard posed by rapidly moving landslides varies considerably across western Oregon. In general, the most hazardous areas are mountainous terrains, which are usually sparsely populated, especially drainage channels and depositional fans associated with debris flows. Where hazard areas intersect with human development, use of the map can help to assess the risk and prioritize risk-reduction activities. Various options are available to reduce the risk of landslide losses. Risk-reduction activities can include engineering solutions, public education, warning systems, temporary road closures and evacuation, land use regulation, and many other options. Although this project addresses a range of rapidly moving landslides, this map is not a compilation of all possible landslide hazards." ;

Influences of fire history and topography on the development of forest structure are evaluated.  Ninty-four fire episodes were reconstructed for the 521-year period from 1475 to 1996. The average mean fire interval, Weibull median probability interval, and maximum fire interval of 4-ha sites were 97 years, 73 years, and 179 years, respectively.  Fire frequency and severity patterns were weakly but significantly associated with spatial variation in hillslope position, slope aspect, slope steepness, and elevation.  Fire frequency was lower for higher elevations, lower slope positions, and more mesic slope aspects. Fre severity was lower for higher elevations, lower slope positions, more north-facing slopes, and more gradual slopes.  Three fire regime classes are defined and mapped.

    glview:description """<section><para>This database was developed to store data for ecophysiology and ecohydrology studies in Watershed 01 (WS01) at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest.  The data include a combination of continuous sensor measurements (e.g. for soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, and relative humidity data) and repeated sampling (e.g., litterfall, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), rock content of soils).

<p> WS01 was clear cut between 1962 and 1966, burned, and replanted to varying degrees of success with Pseudotsuga menziesii, and a set of long-term plots that lie on transects normal to the main stream system was installed in 1962 to monitor plant succession and biomass development (TP073).  The plots for these ecohydrological studies were co-located with a subset of TP073 plots to facilitate cross-referencing and cross-analysis of information.  The boundaries of the TW006 plots are all at least 5 meters outside of the boundaries of the plant succession and biomass plots so as not to interfere with the long term integrity of those plots.</p>  

<p>An initial set of eight plots were installed for TW006 in 2004. All of these plots were located near transect #1 of the TP073 plots; i.e. the transect closest to the mouth of the watershed (see http://oregonstate.edu/feel/mapsVideos/transect_diagram.jpg, http://oregonstate.edu/feel/mapsVideos/airshed_base.pdf, and for a “virtual tour” of the watershed that illustrates the plot locations see http://oregonstate.edu/feel/mapsVideos/WS01_3d_spinningWheel2.AVI.MOV).  Each of the eight plots (also known as “telemetry plots”) is associated with a bank of solar collectors and batteries that provide power for a network of sensors, and data is transmitted by telemetry via a relay station to the Andrews Headquarters. An additional set of 16 plots was established in 2009 to extend data collection through a broader area of the watershed and to represent the full range of vegetation cover classes.  The locations of these was based on a stratified random sampling of TP073 plots.  Data from the 2009 LiDAR reconnaissance were used to do this.  A LiDAR “cover*height” index was assigned to each of the TP073 plots, and the plots were then grouped into five “height*cover” categories.  Three plots were randomly selected from the lowest two categories, two from the highest category, and four each from the remaining categories.  In some cases it was necessary to re-select because the randomly-selected plots were relatively inaccessible, so the final set of plots may be somewhat biased on the basis of access for sampling.  The figure below shows the location of the 16 plots relative to the network of TP073 permanent plots with background colors showing the LiDAR “height*cover” classes.</p>  

<p>All of the 16 plots were used for litterfall collections between 2009-2011. Litter was collected with sets of 5 traps per plot with 43 cm x 43 cm dimensions per plot. The traps were initially installed on August 12. 2009.  Collections began in October, 2009 and continued at monthly intervals during the summer and bi-monthly intervals during the winter for two years.  In 2010, a soil pit of 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm was dug near one of the litter traps for each of the plots and all of the rocks within these pits were excavated, bagged and returned to Dr. Kate Lajtha’s laboratory where they were cleaned, dried and weighed to estimate soil rock content.  Initial analysis of these data suggested that the sample size was too small to adequately represent the range of productivity in the watershed, so four additional plots were added. The plots were further excavated in July and August of 2010 to install two lysimeters (3 inch long, 1 inch diameter remote suction) at a depth of 70-90 cm.</p>  

<p>Starting in November, 2010, lysimeters were evaculated with a hand pump, and between 1 and 7 days later, any water collected in the lysimeters was collected into a vial and returned to the laboratory for analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC).  Sampling continued at irregular intervals thereafter.</p></para></section>""" ;

    glview:description "<section><para>Observed temperatures on “cold air” transects at 33 locations within the HJ Andrews Forest.  Data are sampled every 15 minutes with Hobo portable sensors mounted on rebar approximately 1.5 m above ground.  Radiation shields are the “HJA short” type, which is made from PVC tubing, cut lengthwise and mounted above the sensor; sensors are open to the ground.   Most sensors are located under dense forest canopy, with little solar radiation exposure.  Many sensors also record illumination, which is useful in quantifying light exposure.   The lower Lookout Creek transect (10 stations) is located just to the west of the concrete bridge, and intersects RS10.  The upper Lookout Creek transect (11 stations) extends north from the north slope of Lookout Mountain, across Lookout Creek, and ends below the CENMET benchmark station.  East of the upper transect, there is a short, 4-station transect across Cold Creek, a tributary of Lookout Creek.  North of the upper transect, a 5-station cluster samples locations near a stream channel, above and below a spring.  Single sensors are located downslope from the Roads End rain gauge near the southern border of the forest (high elevation, but locally low topographic position), and near the summit of Carpenter Mountain, on the northern border of the forest (high elevation, high topographic position, exposed to the free atmosphere).  Two sensors will located temporarily in and above a sink northeast of the CENMET benchmark station.  The upper and lower Lookout Creek transects were established in 2002, with others placed at later dates.</para></section>" ;

    glview:description "<section><para>The relationship among land cover, topography, built structure and stream water quality in the Portland Metro region of Oregon and Clark County, Washington areas, USA, is analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted (GWR) multiple regression models. Two scales of analysis, a sectional watershed and a buffer, offered a local and a global investigation of the sources of stream pollutants. Model accuracy, measured by R2 values, fluctuated according to the scale, season, and regression method used. While most wet season water quality parameters are associated with urban land covers, most dry season water quality parameters are related topographic features such as elevation and slope. GWR models, which take into consideration local relations of spatial autocorrelation, had stronger results than OLS regression models. In the multiple regression models, sectioned watershed results were consistently better than the sectioned buffer results, except for dry season pH and stream temperature parameters. This suggests that while riparian land cover does have an effect on water chemistry and quality, a wider contributing area needs to be included in order to account for distant sources of pollutants.</para></section>" ;

    glview:description """<para>We designed and conducted a survey of volunteers who work in city parks in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington to understand natural area volunteer commitment and motivation, as well as the effect that volunteering has on participants’ behavior and attitudes toward the environment. We contrasted volunteer motivation, attitudes, and behaviors between the two cities to better understand the role of governance in organizing volunteer efforts. Participants were sampled over the course of late winter and spring of 2012 during 25 different events. Volunteers’ motivations ranged from environmental reasons to those of personal health. Portland volunteers indicated that helping the environment was their primary motivation, more often than Vancouver volunteers. Portland area volunteers had significantly higher tendency to indicate that their primary gain from volunteering was helping the environment, while Vancouver area volunteers tended to indicate that they were helping their community. Frequency of participation was significantly different between Portland and Vancouver, with 35% in Portland volunteering more than 10 times per year; 21% of Vancouver participants engaged more than 10 times per year. Those engaging in the highest participation level were more likely to engage in public environmental behaviors, such as contacting local officials about environmental issues. Portland volunteers were more likely to feel connected to their volunteer site, and consider themselves environmentalists. 
A total of 131 Portland volunteers and 44 Vancouver volunteers were sampled during the 9-month study. They were asked 48 attitude and behavior questions, including other questions to solicit demographic information including gender, income, and age, and asked about travel time to the site.</para>""" ;

The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Overlook Park, located off Queens Ferry Rd in Towson, Maryland near Overlook Park. The area draining the site is 217 ha and is 13% forested and 40% impervious.

    glview:description "</field>usness for the Baltimore MSA from the NLCD 2001 impervious dataset.  Impervious surfaces refers to impenetrable surfaces such as rooftops, roads or parking lots. Quantification of imperviousness can offer a relatively objective measure of urban density and provide a forum for its classification. For NLCD 2001, imperviousness was chosen as the surrogate for the urban intensity classification in an effort to improve the precision of urban characterization used in the original NLCD 1992. Modeling empirical relationships between imperviousness and Landsat data is accomplished using regression tree techniques. Several one-meter digital orthophoto quadrangles are used for each Landsat scene to derive reference impervious data needed for calibrating the relationships between percent imperviousness and Landsat spectral data, which are then modeled using a commercial regression tree algorithm called Cubist. The models are then applied to all pixels in a mapping zone to produce a per-pixel estimate of imperviousness in urban areas (Yang et al., 2002). This procedure quantifies the spatial distribution of impervious surfaces as a continuous variable for urban areas from 1 to 100%, and offers a consistent and repeatable method to characterize urban areas across the Nation. This data layer is then masked to ensure only urban pixels are included and thresholded (Table 1) into NLCD 2001 urban classes and inserted into the land cover. Imperviousness information will be available as an independent product of NLCD 2001.  The National Land Cover Database 2001 for mapping zone 60 was produced  through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land  Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of  federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey  (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS),  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management  (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of  the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent,  seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for  the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition  and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al.  (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp.  The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A  total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S.  based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edgematching features  and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. Mapping zone 60 encompasses  whole or portions of several states in the mid-Atlantic region, including  the states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and  the District of Columbia. Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 60 can be  directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS EROS Data  Center (EDC), Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

    glview:description "Geocoded for Baltimore City County.  The BES Household Survey 2003 is a telephone survey of metropolitan Baltimore residents consisting of 29 questions. The survey research firm, Hollander, Cohen, and McBride conducted the survey, asking respondents questions about their outdoor recreation activities, watershed knowledge, environmental behavior, neighborhood characteristics and quality of life, lawn maintenance, satisfaction with life, neighborhood, and the environment, and demographic information. The data from each respondent is also associated with a PRIZM(r) classification, census block group, and latitude-longitude. PRIZM(r) classifications categorize the American population using Census data, market research surveys, public opinion polls, and point-of-purchase receipts. The PRIZM(r) classification is spatially explicit allowing the survey data to be viewed and analyzed spatially and allowing specific neighborhood types to be identified and compared based on the survey data. The census block group and latitude-longitude data also allow us additional methods of presenting and analyzing the data spatially.  The household survey is part of the core data collection of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study to classify and characterize social and ecological dimensions of neighborhoods (patches) over time and across space. This survey is linked to other core data including US Census data, remotely-sensed data, and field data collection, including the BES DemSoc Field Observation Survey.  The BES 2003 telephone survey was conducted by Hollander, Cohen, and McBride from September 1-30, 2003. The sample was obtained from the professional sampling firm Claritas, in order that their \"PRIZM\" encoding would be appended to each piece of sample (telephone number) supplied. Mailing addresses were also obtained so that a postcard could be sent in advance of interviewers calling. The postcard briefly informed potential respondents about the survey, who was conducting it, and that they might receive a phone call in the next few weeks. A stratified sampling method was used to obtain between 50 - 150 respondents in each of the 15 main PRIZM classifications. This allows direct comparison of PRIZM classifications. Analysis of the data for the general metropolitan Baltimore area must be weighted to match the population proportions normally found in the region. They obtained a total of 9000 telephone numbers in the sample. All 9,000 numbers were dialed but contact was only made on 4,880. 1508 completed an interview, 2524 refused immediately, 147 broke off/incomplete, 84 respondents had moved and were no longer in the correct location, and a qualified respondent was not available on 617 calls. This resulted in a response rate of 36.1% compared with a response rate of 28.2% in 2000. The CATI software (Computer Assisted Terminal Interviewing) randomized the random sample supplied, and was programmed for at least 3 attempted callbacks per number, with emphasis on pulling available callback sample prior to accessing uncalled numbers. Calling was conducted only during evening and weekend hours, when most head of households are home. The use of CATI facilitated stratified sampling on PRIZM classifications, centralized data collection, standardized interviewer training, and reduced the overall cost of primary data collection. Additionally, to reduce respondent burden, the questionnaire was revised to be concise, easy to understand, minimize the use of open-ended responses, and require an average of 15 minutes to complete.  The household survey is part of the core data collection of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study to classify and characterize social and ecological dimensions of neighborhoods (patches) over time and across space. This survey is linked to other core data, including US Census data, remotely-sensed data, and field data collection, including the BES DemSoc Field Observation Survey. Additional documentation of this database is attached to this metadata and includes 4 documents, 1) the telephone survey, 2) documentation of the telephone survey, 3) metadata for the telephone survey, and 4) a description of the attribute data in the BES survey 2003 survey. This database was created by joining the GDT geographic database of US Census Block Group geographies for the Baltimore Metropolitan Statisticsal Area (MSA), with the Claritas PRIZM database, 2003, of unique classifications of each Census Block Group, and the unique PRIZM code for each respondent from the BES Household Telephone Survey, 2003. The GDT database is preferred and used because of its higher spatial accuracy than other databases describing US Census geographies, including those provided by the US Census. This database includes data only for environmental behaviors: How likely would you be to take part in the following efforts to improve and maintain the quality of the watersheds near where you live, very unlikely, somewhat unlikely, somewhat likely, very likely?  a) pay increased recreation or other usage fees, b) support a modest (small) tax increase to be used for water quality issues, c) support legislation to require all developments be set back from streams and flood plains, and d) volunteer to work on cleanup and/or pollution patrols.\" The response is the percentage of respondents in that Prizm class who score \"somewhat likely\" or \"very likely\" on an index across all four of the environmental behavior questions.  This is part of a collection of 221 Baltimore Ecosystem Study metadata records that point to a geodatabase.  The geodatabase is available online and is considerably large.

    glview:description "Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). Plots were surveyed in to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plot which is 900 m2. The Hillsdale plot is smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot." ;

Each of the gaging sites is continuously monitored for discharge and is sampled weekly for chemistry. Additional chemical sampling is carried out in a supplemental set of sites to provide a greater range of land use. Weekly analyses includes nitrate, phosphate, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chloride and sulfate, total suspended solids, turbidity, fecal coliforms, temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH.

The study contributes to our understanding of whether competitive interactions between tree seedlings are likely to help maintain deciduous stands across disturbance cycles by reducing the potential for successful conifer establishment.

All trees and tall shrubs within the plot are stem mapped, and the dbh is measured at least every 5 years. The condition of each tree is assessed at the time of measurement and following major disturbance events. Band dendrometers have been placed on select trees at each site where applicable. Litterfall and seedfall are collected and measured annually. White spruce seedlings are mapped and their heights measured every 2 years within the tree plots at younger successional stages. The DBH of alders and willows are measured. Shrub heights are measured annually at young floodplain stands.

    glview:description "</field>cts of browsing by moose and snowshoe hares on fine root production, mortality and decomposition in early successional forest ecosystems along the Tanana River floodplain in interior Alaska were studied over a 3 year period using minirhizotrons placed inside and outside large permanent exclosures. Fine root production and mortality varied seasonally, with greatest rates of production occurring during June each year, and greatest rates of mortality occurring in fall and over winter. Annual production and mortality during 1993, a year of unusually low precipitation, were significantly higher than during either 1992 or 1994. Aboveground herbivory significantly reduced monthly rates of fine root production, and on an annual basis, fine root production of browsed plots (311.4 - 31.7 mm tube-1 yr-1) was significantly less than that of unbrowsed plots (453.8 - 49.8 mm tube-1 yr-1) when averaged over 3 years. Because herbivory had less of an effect on monthly or annual rates of fine root mortality, fine root turnover was higher for browsed stands. Browsed plants had a higher percentage of annual production in surface soil layers. Production on all plots shifted to deeper soil layers as the growing season progressed; this shift occurred deeper in the profile for unbrowsed plants than for browsed plants. We used a parameter estimation program (Program MARK) to generate fine root survival and decomposition estimates from models testing the direct and interactive effects of time period, cohort, i.e., when the root first appeared, age of the root, browsing, and site on fine root longevity and decomposability. Cohort effects showed that survival of fine roots was greatest for roots that first appeared in May, and progressively declined for roots first appearing during subsequent time periods, while aged-based estimates showed a rapid decline in survival over the interval following first appearance. Survival and decomposition estimates were inversely correlated within a growing season, with the lowest survival but highest decomposition occurring over winter. Two-factor models indicated that time-dependent survival and decomposition rates of fine roots differed significantly between browsed and unbrowsed stands, among the 10 fine-root age-groups, and the 3 study sites. Browsing significantly reduced fine root survival, but this effect varied among sites. Contrary to our predictions, fine root decomposition rates were consistently lower (-21%) in browsed stands. Two important features distinguish fine root dynamics in our stands from temperate and more southerly boreal ecosystems: (1) low over-winter survival of fine roots, and (2) a substantial time lag between leaf out and maximum fine root growth, suggesting greater reliance on aboveground stores for spring regrowth. Herbivores appear to play an important role in linking these two events, first by exacerbating over-winter mortality and secondly by consuming a substantial amount of aboveground stores. Thus, not only do herbivores have pronounced direct effects on carbon and nutrient cycling processes, but climatically driven effects on fine root processes may be linked with herbivory in complex ways that define fundamental latitudinal patterns in plant growth and allocation to defense against herbivory." ;

We measured soil respiration in three replicate pairs of sites (planned burned, control) in two vegetation types (black spruce, mixed hardwoods) using a LiCor 6262 infrared gas analyzer attached to semi-automated chambers (3 replicate chambers per site).  Measurements began in summer 1998 and continued each growing season through 2004; in addition, we measured winter respiration during winter 1998-1999 using a different chamber design on top of the snow pack.  All of the black spruce sites were located on Helmer's Ridge; the mixed hardwood sites initially were located on the east side of the C4 watershed or just outside its eastern boundary.  Following the 1999 fire, all of the mixed hardwood sites were moved burned and unburned areas near the main trail ascending Helmer's Ridge." ;

    glview:description "Snow surveys in the West date back to around 1906, when the University of Nevada's Dr. James Church laid out the first western snow course. Dr. Church also invented key sampling procedures and equipment.  A snow course is a permanent site where manual measurements of snow depth and snow water equivalent are taken by trained observers.  Measurements are usually taken around the first of the month during the winter and spring. Generally, the courses are about 1,000 feet long and are situated in small meadows protected from the wind.  Snow survey data can be used to help determine the weight the snowpack exerts on the ground at the site in that area or elevation zone. To determine the snow load, one needs to know how much the snowpack weighs. The weight of the snow varies with water content of the snowpack. The snow water equivalent (SWE) or water content of the snowpack, is the amount of water in the snowpack measured in inches if you were to melt the snowpack." ;

The 1983 Rosie Creek Fire was a human-caused wildfire that burned 8,600 acres including about 1/3 of the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. The old growth white spruce reference stand was expanded by 1.0 ha to two contiguous hectares, and the burned aspen stand by 0.25 ha to one full hectare (initial) plus an adjacent quarter-hectare.

    glview:description """In this larger study, we are asking the question: Is old carbon that comprises the bulk of the soil organic matter pool released in response to thawing of permafrost?  We are answering this question by using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure radiocarbon isotope ratios in soil organic matter, soil respiration, and dissolved organic carbon, in tundra ecosystems.  The objective of these proposed measurements is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the SOM sources contributing to C losses following permafrost thawing.  We are making these measurements at an established tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range.  Field measurements center on a natural permafrost thaw gradient and an experimental warming site.  As such, this area is unique for addressing questions at the time and spatial scales relevant for change in arctic ecosystems.  This data set includes hourly mean values of PAR, relative humidity, air temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and hourly summed precipitation.

The Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project addresses the following questions: 1) Does ecosystem warming cause a net release of C from the ecosystem to the atmosphere?, 2) Does the decomposition of old C, that comprises the bulk of the soil C pool, influence ecosystem C loss?, and 3) How do winter and summer warming alone, and in combination, affect ecosystem C exchange? We are answering these questions using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure ecosystem carbon balance and radiocarbon isotope ratios at a warming experiment located in an upland tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. This data set provides annual meterological data.""" ;

    glview:description """This study sought to determine the conversion factor between acetylene reduction and N-fixation rates by root nodules excised from naturally-occurring Alnus tenuifolia and Alnus crispa plants in 18 sites in the BNZ-LTER. N-fixation rate was measured via uptake of 15N2 by excised nodule tissue. Sites were chosen to represent three replicates of early, mid, and late successional habitats on the Tanana River floodplain and in surrounding upland areas. A. tenuifolia was sampled in floodplain sites, and A. crispa in uplands. Parameters measured: acetylene reduction rate, N2 fixation rate, ratio of acetylene reduced to N2 fixed, soil temperature, leaf del 15N, and specific leaf weight.

Most of the fixed nitrogen (N) that enters the N cycle in Alaskan forests is fixed biologically by alder (Alnus spp.) in symbiosis with the N-fixing bacterial genus Frankia. Estimates of gross N inputs resulting from this process ultimately rely on accurate measurement of N-fixation by nodule tissue. These rates are typically estimated by measuring rates of acetylene reduction by nodule tissue, then using an empirically determined conversion factor to obtain the corresponding N fixation rate. The purposes of this study were to determine: 1) the conversion factor(s) for Alnus tenuifolia and Alnus crispa in the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest, and 2) whether the conversion factor varied between plants occurring in different successional habitats.""" ;

    glview:description """Ledum palustre (Labrador tea) is a late successional evergreen shrub widely distributed in boreal ecosystems that readily leaches high concentrations of soluble phenolic compounds into water. We selected this species in order to study whether leaf leachates could be responsible for the effects of plant canopy on N cycling under natural conditions. Organic matter content, soil respiration and net N mineralization were measured in organic and mineral soil horizons and gross N mineralization was also measured in mineral soils sampled underneath L. palustre in a hardwood forest dominated by Populus tremuloides and Betula neoalaskana. Soils were amended with L. palustre litter leachates and incubated in the laboratory. Because mineral soil is also influenced by the overlying organic horizon we also characterized some simple indices of the organic horizon carbon quality (lignin, cellulose and condensed tannins) to look for differences in likely decomposability.
Our objectives were i) to determine whether L. palustre presence and L. palustre leachates addition changed soil N availability, and ii) to determine the specific N cycling processes that were affected, including changes in mineralization, nitrification or immobilization. We wanted to know whether L. palustre leachates could be a mechanism through which plant presence would impact N cycling.""" ;

Sites were selected from satellite classifications prepared by Eric Kasischke to represent different levels of burn severity and post-fire vegetation canopy greenness (NDVI). Site selection was constrained by road access, and only areas where all trees had been killed by the fire were selected.  At each site, a central point was located in an area of visually homogeneous vegetation. Five parallel transects, each 50 m long, were laid out as follows:  1) the first transect started at the central point and followed a randomly-selected compass direction,  2) two additional transects were established parallel to the first, but at a random distance from the central transect up to 25 m distant.  Vegetation was sampled in a 2-m wide belt centered on each transect, and soil samples were made at intervals along the transect line.

General notes were made on visual percent cover of different vegetation growth forms at the site. Destructive measurements of tree seedlings and willows made in 2001 were used to develop allometric equations to predict dry biomass from basal diameter.

    glview:description """This data set is a hill shade, of the 1:250000 scale Digital Elevation Model of
                Arizona. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology adopted by the USGS to
                describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital raster form. The standard DEM
                consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a designated coordinate projection
                system. The DEM data are stored as a series of profiles in which the spacing of the
                elevations along and between each profile is in regular whole number intervals. The
                normal orientation of data is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of
                elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to
                east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A-record), followed by a
                series of profile records (B-records) each of which include a short B-record header
                followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each profile. The last physical
                record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). A 30-minute DEM (2- by 2-arc
                second data spacing) consists of four 15-by 15-minute DEM blocks. Two 30-minute
                DEM's provide the same coverage as a standard USGS 30- by 60-minute quadrangle.
                Saleable units are 30- by 30-minute blocks, that is, four 15- by 15-minute DEM's
                representing one half of a 1:100,000-scale map.""" ;

The survey will measure the social ties of individuals to their communities, values and sentiments regarding communities, behaviors that affect the natural environment, and satisfaction with the quality of life in the area. The community that people experience most intimately is the neighborhood. Our central research questions ask how neighborhood social ties, values, and behaviors are connected with one another in ways that reflect willingness to act socially and politically with respect to the environment, and how changing environmental conditions, in turn, affect the quality of human life." ;

    glview:description "Land cover classification for the CAP LTER study region using ASTER imagery acquired September 19, 2000. Current classification is broadly similar to previous classifications using Landsat TM by Stefanov et al (2001). Three visible bands (15m/pixel) of ASTER were used to perfom a multistep classification of the area. The fifteen-class classification is produced by applying the expert system approach and using the initially derived 16-class minimum distance to means (MDM) supervised classification, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), spatial variance texture image, and land use vector coverage. The overall classification accuracy is 88.06%. Although it does not cover the entire CAP LATER, the dataset can be used as higher spatial resolution alternative to Landsat-derived land cover." ;

                in CAPLTER. This dataset represents spatially interpolated ozone (O3) levels as
                measured by monitroring stations of the Maricopa County Air Quality Department. O3
                is a naturally occurring compound in which three oxygen atoms combine together. This
                is an unstable combination, and ozone is continually going through a natural cycle
                of being formed and then converting back to the more stable â€œnormalâ€� double
                oxygen compound (O2). The cycle occurs fairly rapidly. In the stratosphere (6 miles
                and more above the earth), naturally occurring ozone has a beneficial effect of
                screening out harmful ultraviolet light from the sun. However, ground-level ozone is
                a pollutant and is a major component of the brown haze that is often observed in the

					between plants that have typical levels of mycorrhizal colonization and those
					with lower, suppressed levels of colonization.  The impact of AM fungi on the productivity of brittlebush plants

                vegetation densities. Morning CO2 levels are higher than afternoon levels and
                correspond closely to the density of traffic, population, and employment. The
                spatial structure of human activity explains the pattern of CO2 better on weekdays
                than on weekends. CO2 surfaces reflect declining densities of human activity with
                distance from the city center, the pattern of irrigated agriculture in the Phoenix
                area, and riparian habitats on the urban fringe. Spatial and temporal patterns of

    glview:description """Phenology is the seasonal timing of environment-mediated events such as
          growth and reproduction.  Phenology is quantified by determining time of onset
          and end of events, duration, and number of flowers (Augspurger 1983, Rathcke and Lacey
          1985).  Studies of flowering and leafing phenology have dramatically increased
          during the last few decades due to growing concerns over global climate change and because
          phenology is a highly sensitive indicator that researchers can use to study the effects of
          climate change at multiple scales (Chuine et al. 2000, Sparks and Menzel 2002, Peuelas
          et al. 2004, Williams and Abberton 2004).  Urban climatic conditions are
          considered similar to the changing global climate conditions; therefore, many researchers
          study urbanized areas as smaller scale experiments, or models, of global climate change
          (Ziska et al. 2003).  Concerns over climate change are not the only reasons for
          studying urban ecosystems.  It is important to create urban environments
          resilient to social, economic, and ecological collapse.  The literature of flowering phenology in urban environments suggests that
          spring-blooming plants in urban environments located in temperate, Mediterranean, and
          boreal ecosystems in North America, Europe, and China tend to bloom earlier in the city
          than in the surrounding un-urbanized habitat (Roetzer et al. 2000, Fitter and Fitter 2002,
          White et al. 2002, Ziska et al. 2003, Zhang et al. 2004).  Moreover, non-woody
          plants, early spring bloomers, and insect-pollinated plants in these environments tend to
          be more sensitive than woody plants, mid- or late-spring bloomers, and wind-pollinated
          plants (Fitter and Fitter 2002, Traidl-Hoffman et al. 2003).  Finally,
          temperature (Heat Island Effect) has been assumed to be the cause of earlier flowering in
          the urban environments since the large-scale advancement of flowering has been strongly
          correlated with global warming.  Study of flowering phenology in urban ecosystems is important
          because changes in phenology may have wide-reaching consequences.  Explicit study
          of the potential consequences of any changes in flowering phenology in urbanized areas has
          not been widely addressed; however, general ecological consequences from phenological
          changes due to global climate change have been hypothesized and studied, such as earlier
          and extended pollen allergy season (e.g., Van Vliet et al. 2002, Traidl-Hoffman et al.
          2003, Ziska et al. 2003) and mis-matches in synchronized inter-specific interactions
          (e.g., Kudo et al. 2004).  These effects of global climate change may be similar
          to changes and consequences in urban ecosystems.  Other potential consequences
          include effects on:  individual fitness (e.g. offspring production and
          viability); intra-specific interactions (e.g., genetic mixing); plant inter-specific
          interactions (e.g., resource competition); non-plant inter-specific interactions (e.g.,
          pests, pollinators, pathogens, herbivores); economics (e.g., any agriculture occurring
          near or within cities, including the floral industry and crops that require pollination by
          native organisms; also, private gardens); and human health (e.g., pollinosis,
          psychological well-being/appeal).""" ;

				Agricultural and urban developments introduce growth multimodality, which is not

				Despite the existence of summer flush of growth in the desert its signal is not

The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grids and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogenfertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman." ;

    glview:description "Process-based models of plant litter decomposition typically underestimate the rates of decomposition in arid and semi-arid grasslands. Recent research, including our field studies, suggests that photodegradation, the decomposition of material through solar radiation, may play an important role in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems. The contribution of photodegradation to overall rates of decomposition is not well understood or quantified. The goal of this project is to investigate the effects of ultraviolet radiation on rates of plant litter decomposition for two grass species, Andropogon gerardii and Bouteloua gracilis, in three grassland sites: Cedar Creek (MN), Shortgrass Steppe (CO), and Sevilleta (NM)." ;

    glview:description """BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. 
 
Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? 
 
While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts.  Some of these are: 
 
1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising.  Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today.  This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning.  It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm.  CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 
 
2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past.  While natural \"background\" levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically.  Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 
 
3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. 
 
While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain.  There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously.  BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve.""" ;

    glview:description "The purpose of this experiment is to measure how adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. The experiment is being conducted within fields (A, B, C, and D) which were initially low in soil nutrients. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. There are 6 replicates of the 9 treatments in fields A, B, and C and 5 replicates in field D. The treatments were randomly assigned to the plots. In fields A, B, and C the plots are in 6 by 9 grids and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. In field D the plots are 1.5 by 4 meters and are placed in a 3 by 17 grid. The plots are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. Nitrogenfertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. This experiment was begun in 1982 by David Tilman." ;

In this full-factorial experiment, 36 high-diversity 9 m x 9 m plots that were planted with 32 species in 1994 were randomly assigned to one of six treatments. Treatments were all combination of a water treatment (ambient rainfall or ambient rainfall plus ~ 2 cm/week of irrigation) and of a nitrogen treatment (annual nitrogen addition of 0,  7, or 14 grams of N - as ammonium nitrate - per square meter).  Aboveground biomass is harvested each fall in each plot, dried, and weighed. These treatments are determining the importance of both water and N limitation in high-diversity restored prairie grassland, their interactive effects, and the year-to-year variation in yields and treatment effects. They are also determining the potential sustainability of such yields and the effects of the various treatments on plant diversity." ;

The \"BAC\" experiment is designed to determine the direct and interactive effects of plant species numbers, plant community composition, temperature, and precipitation on 11 productivity, C and N dynamics, stability, and plant, microbe, and insect species abundances in CDR grassland ecosystems. 
 
The experiment uses a subset of 42 plots from the Biodiversity experiment: 14 monoculture plots (one randomly chosen replicate for each of the 14 non-woody species that became well established in monoculture), 14 plots planted to 4 species (randomly chosen from 4-species plots planted with combination of these 14 species), and 14 plots planted to 16 species (randomly chosen from all 16 species plots containing these 14 species). Plant species are from 4 different functional groups (4 species, each, of C3 grasses, C4 grasses, legumes and non-legume forbs) that are likely to respond differently to changes in temperature and water availability. Treatments, to be applied to 4 subplots (3 m x 4 m each) within each of these 42 plots, will create conditions that are (a) warmer than ambient, (b) warmer and watered, (c) ambient temperature but watered, and (d) un-warmed and un-watered, i.e., a full factorial of ambient or elevated temperature and of ambient or elevated precipitation. Temperature will be increased using infrared heat lamps (DeValpine and Harte 2001, Kimball 2005), and increased precipitation using automatic sprinklers; both methods were tested and refined in 2005.""" ;

    glview:description "</field>cted monthly observations of water microbial characteristics from each of the FCE LTER sites beginning in February 2001.  Bacteria counts using DAPI epifluorescence, heterotrophic bacteria production with tritiated Thymidine uptake, and algal energetics and chl a using the PAM fluorometer were determined from each of the water samples.  Bacteria counts in Shark River Slough in the freshwater end of the transect revealed highest bacteria numbers upon marsh rewetting after the dry down.  The highest overall count of bacteria was found at the most freshwater point adjacent to the perimeter of the water conservation area but only in March of 2001.  Peak numbers of bacteria in the saline end of Shark River transect occurred in December and July.  There is some evidence that these higher bacteria numbers in the SR transect are associated with higher salinities.   Highest bacteria counts along the Taylor slough transect were observed at the mouth of the Taylor River with peak counts in the wet season in October.  Bacteria densities also increased  from the eastern to western end of the transect in Florida Bay.  Heterotrophic bacterial production did not relate closely bacteria numbers and exhibited highest numbers in the dry season.  There was no discernible relationship between salinity and bacteria production as seen in bacteria numbers.  Monthly observations using PAM fluorometry revealed that brown algae was the greatest contribution to the algal chal a pool and this relationship was consistent across all FCE LTER sites.  Converse to the pattern of bacteria abundance along the Shark River transect, there was evidence that algal biomass decreases from freshwater to estuary.  In the Shark River, algal energetics increased from marsh to estuary as well as in the panhandle region of the Taylor River transect.  From these observations we conclude the behavior of the microbial loop and interactions generated between functional guilds is highly variable along individual transects and between the Shark River and Taylor River transect.  Wet dry season dynamics partially explain temporal variability in microbial dynamics along the individual transects yet responses were unique for each section of the transect as freshwater versus estuarine versus Bay.   Relationships between salinity and microbial parameters in this case, were not easily discerned but were more consistent within the two river transects than between river transects." ;

    glview:description "Î´13C values were determined from cypress tree rings from two different study areas in South Florida. One site is located in the Southeastern Everglades Marsh, where pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) was sampled from tree islands (annual tree rings from 1970 to 2000). Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) trees were sampled at the other site, located along the Loxahatchee River in a coastal wetland (decadal tree rings from 1830 to 1990). The isotopic time series from both sites display different, location-specific information. The pond cypress isotopic time series has a positive correlation with the total amount of annual precipitation, while the bald cypress data from the Loxahatchee River study area had two different records dependent on the level of saltwater stress. In general, for terrestrial trees growing in a temperate environment, water stress causes an increase in water-use efficiency (WUE) resulting in a relative 13C enrichment. Yet, trees growing in wetland settings in some cases do not respond in the same manner. We propose a conceptual model based on changes in carbon assimilation and isotopic fractionation as controlled by differences in stomatal resistance (water stress) and mesophyll resistance (biochemical and nutrient related) to explain the isotopic records from both sites. With further work and a longer time series, our approach may be tested, and used to reconstruct change in hydroperiods further back in time, and potentially provide a baseline for wetland restoration." ;

    glview:description "Estuarine mixing interfaces have been a focus of wetland ecologists for the last three decades and are of growing concern today.  Particularly critical in Everglades restoration, water quality and the dynamics of nutrients and dissolved materials across seasons in the natural system are being defined.  We measured diurnal and seasonal (wet and dry) variation in microbial, dissolved and total nutrients and total organic carbon along a riverine transect and for a diurnal cycle in October of 2001 and March of 2002.  For the diurnal sampling we anchored a houseboat mid Shark River 100m up river of the mesohaline Florida Coastal Everglades Shark River LTER site and sampled the water for chemical, microbial, and physical parameters.  At slack high and low tides we sampled 10 miles offshore then at three sites up the Shark River.  TOC (mM) and salinity (ppt) were highly correlated (r2 .97) along the river transect across seasons and TOC derived from terrestrial input.   Bacterial production ranged from 1.88 to 10.99 mg C l-1 d-1 and was greatest in the dry season and at the most freshwater sampling points.  Combined examination of our 49 sampled parameters both from the diurnal sampling and river transect sampling showed that our position for sampling in the river was critical and that the mid river-estuarine productivity maxima occurred within Shark River in both the wet and dry season.  These data suggest this oligotrophic estuarine-river system is highly sensitive to watershed and river fringe nutrient inputs and remineralization vectors within the river." ;

    glview:description "A better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients in the Florida Coastal Everglades is a key issue regarding the restoration of the Everglades, which is expected to change the water quality throughout South Florida.  In addition to rain, the main freshwater supply to Florida Bay will be derived from Taylor Slough and the C-111 Basin in the north-east section of the Bay.  While it is known that these areas deliver significant amounts of nitrogen to the Bay, a significant portion of this nitrogen is in its dissolved organic form (DON).  The sources, environmental fate and bioavailability to microorganisms of this DON are however, not known.  Preliminary data suggest that although proteins have been detected in canal samples, labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) components were found to increase in abundance in the freshwater marshes compared to their levels in the adjacent canal waters.  Leaching experiments of biomass showed the presence of such labile DOM.  However, this DOM was found to be susceptible to both biodegradation and photodecomposition.  In this study we will focus on the determination of the molecular characteristics of both DOM and DON and assess the bioavailability of these materials in transects ranging from the C-111 canal and Taylor Slough to the central part of Florida Bay.  Relevant water quality and spectroscopic parameters will be monitored at 11 sites on a monthly basis, while six of these sites will be sampled biannually for DOM and DON chemical characterization and bioavailability studies.  Advanced analytical techniques such as pyrolysis-GC/MS, FTIR, 13C- and 15N-NMR, gel electrophoresis and LC/MS will be used in the molecular characterization effort.  We envisage that this study will allow for a better assessment of the sources of DON and its bioavailability in this system." ;

    glview:description "Water samples are collected at the end of the dry and the wet season from all LTER sites and stored on ice until return to the lab. They are pre-filtered through pre-combusted GF/F filters and ultrafiltered and concentrated with a Pellicon 2 Mini tangential flow ultrafiltration system.Concentrated samples were then analyzed using fluorescence and SEC-HPLC. This CDOM optical study revealed the presence of two classes of compounds associated with the protein-like peak (peak T; excitation/emission (Ex/Em) maxima at around 280 nm/325 nm), which have very different chemical structures and ecological roles.  In addition to proteins, we propose phenolic compounds as possible origins of peak T in coastal and wetland environments.  In this study, natural water samples were obtained from subtropical rivers and estuarine environments within the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) ecosystem. The samples were ultra-filtered and excitation-emission fluorescence matrices (EEMs) were obtained. The EEMs showed the presence of four peaks with Ex/Em maxima at around 280 nm/325 nm (T), less than 260 nm/460 nm (A), 300 nm/412nm (M), and 350 nm/470 nm (C).  To better understand the nature of peak T, the components originating this peak were separated using size exclusion chromatography  (SEC) and detected by fluorescence emission at Ex/Em = 280 nm/325 nm.  The elution curves revealed the presence of two elution peaks at a molecular weight of greater than 50K (void volume; T1) and around 7.6K (T2).  This result suggested the need of cautious interpretation in the use of peak T as a proxy for the detection of proteinaceous materials in wetland and estuarine environments, since significant amounts of potentially interfering phenolic compounds are leached from senescent biomass in wetland and coastal ecosystems.  As such EEM spectra of gallic acid an important component of hydrolysable tannins, and condensed tannins extracted from red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) showed the presence of a peak maxima at a similar position to peak T (260/346 and 275/313 nm, respectively), suggesting these phenolic compounds can be possible sources of peak T." ;

    glview:description "Dissolved organic matter plays an important role in biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments such as elemental cycling, microbial loop energetics, and the transport of materials across landscapes.  Since most of N (Greater than 90%) and P (around 90%) is in the organic form in the oligotrophic subtropical Florida Coastal Estuaries (FCES), study of the source and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ecosystem is crucial for the better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.  FCES are composed of estuaries with distinct regions with different biogeochemical processes.  Florida Bay (FB) is a wedge-shaped shallow oligotrophic estuary which lays south of the Everglades, the bottom of which is covered with a dense biomass of seagrass.  Whitewater bay (WWB) is a semi-enclosed mangrove estuary with a relatively long residence time, which receives overland freshwater input from the Everglades marshes.  Ten thousand Islands (TTI) covers the southwest margin of the Florida Coastal Everglades, which are highly compartmentalized by local geomorphology.  The sources of both freshwater and nutrients in FCES are difficult to quantify, owing to the non-point source nature of runoff from the Everglades and the dendritic cross channels in the mangroves.  Furthermore, the combination of multiple DOM sources (freshwater marsh vegetation, mangroves, phytoplankton, seagrass, etc.), and the potential seasonal variability of their relative contribution, along with the history of (photo)chemical and microbial diagenetic processing, and complex advective circulation, makes the study of DOM dynamics in FCES particularly difficult using standard schemes of estuarine ecology.  Quantitative information of DOM is very useful to investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DOM to a certain degree, however, qualitative information is necessary to better understand the source and dynamics of DOM.  Since fluorescence spectroscopic techniques are very sensitive, quick and simple, they have been applied to investigate the fate of DOM in estuaries." ;

    glview:description "The objective of this study was to investigate in detail the molecular characteristics of DOM in a sub-tropical, oligotrophic aquatic environment, namely the Florida coastal Everglades, along a freshwater wetland, mangrove fringe to estuarine transect.  For this purpose, surface waters from five sites along Taylor Slough ranging from freshwater marsh to mangrove ecotone environments, as well as three sites within the Florida Bay estuary were collected for analyses.  Fluorescence properties of DOM were measured for a quick assessment of DOM quality. Ultrafiltered DOM samples (UDOM; less than 0.7 um, greater than 1000 Da) were concentrated and freeze dried for the determination of bulk C composition, lignin-phenol concentration, and neutral sugar composition. These molecular characteristics were investigated by 13C-NMR spectroscopy, TMAH thermochemolysis, and hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), respectively.  Furthermore, UDOM samples were classified by cluster analysis based on their pyrolysis products obtained via flash pyrolysis-GC/MS." ;

    glview:description "A better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients entering Florida Bay is a key issue regarding the restoration of the Everglades.  In addition to precipitation, the other major source of freshwater to Florida Bay is from Taylor Slough and the C-111 Basin in the northeast section of the Bay.  While it is known that these areas deliver significant amounts of N to the Bay, a significant portion of this is in the form of dissolved organic N (DON).  The sources, environmental fate and bioavailability to microorganisms of this DON are however, not known.  Should this DON be readily available, any increased load as a function of restoration changes might have an impact on internal phytoplankton bloom dynamics.  No significant flocculation or precipitation of DOM occurred with increase in salinity, meaning  that terrestrial DOM does not get trapped in the sediments but stays in the water column where it subjected to photolysis and advective transport.  Sunlight has a significant effect on the chemical characteristics of DOM.  While the DOC levels did not change significantly during photo-exposure, the optical characteristics of the DOM were modified.  The environmental implications of this are conflicting: photo-induced polymerization may stabilize the DOM by reducing its bioavailability while photolysis may make the DOM more labile.  Overall, DON bioavailability was relatively low in this region. Even though the amount of DON loaded to the bay may be significant, the fraction of DON available for microbial cycling is much smaller.  The amount of N supplied by recycling may be a significant portion of the total DIN pool.  All this must be considered in context with the proposed CERP modifications to flows.  As of the latest initial Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP) update, the flows to Taylor Slough and C-111/Panhandle Basis are not predicted to change very much from base conditions.  Therefore we do not expect any great increases in TN loading in this region.  In contrast, the proposed flow increases to the Shark River Slough are large and may have significant effects on transport of DOM to the Southwest Florida Shelf.  We believe that future efforts in DON characterization and bioavailability should be concentrated in this area." ;

    glview:description "Several studies have shown that within the Florida Coastal Everglades, periphyton mat properties, (incuding biomass, nutrient and organic content, and community composition) vary predictably in response to water quality.The Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) wetland system is very similar with respect to climate, geology, hydrology and vegetation, to wetlands found in Jamaica, the Yucatan region of Mexico and parts of Belize. This study was therefore conducted to ascertain (i) the level of similarity between the periphyton diatom communities from karstic wetland sites in Belize, Mexico, Jamaica and comparable sites within the FCE, (ii) the relationship between periphyton biomass, TP levels and diatom community composition at these sites, and (iii) the feasibility of employing diatoms as indicators of water quality at these sites, using models relating diatom community composition to water quality from comparable sites within the FCE.  Multiple wetland sites in Jamaica, the Yucatan region of Mexico and parts of Belize were visited between 2006 and 2008, during wet and dry seasons. At each site physico-chemical data were collected along with periphyton samples. The periphyton samples were processed in accordance with standard methods to obtain biomass, organic content and TP measures, and to identify and enumerate diatom and soft algae species. Various aspects of the diatom communities were then compared to previously compiled data on diatom communities from various parts of the FCE. SIMI analysis was used to determine the level of similarity between the systems and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling was used to identify relationships between diatom communities and water quality." ;

    glview:description "Seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer mixes with the discharging fresh water to form a zone of mixed composition.  This mixing zone is considered to be geochemical important in a carbonate aquifer as an area of enhanced carbonate mineral dissolution and,or precipitation.  Ion exchange reactions are also common within the mixing zone as the dominant cation in seawater, sodium, replaces other ions adsorbed to the aquifer matrix.  Phosphorus has a strong affinity for adsorption to calcium carbonate minerals.  Both the dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals as well as ion exchange reactions have the potential to release phosphorus from the aquifer matrix to the groundwater.  Discharge of this phosphorus-laden groundwater, as induced by the fresh/saline water interface, may then be an additional source of phosphorus to the overlying coastal environments.  Both surface water and groundwater were collected across the seawater intrusion zone of the coastal Everglades in south Florida during the summer of 2003. Hydrogen sulfide was released from the groundwater wells during sampling, indicating the groundwater was most likely anoxic.  In order to reduce the potential exposure of the groundwater to oxygen during sampling, groundwater samples were collected in the following manner.  Groundwater wells were first purged of at least three well volumes prior to sampling.  Water samples were then collected using a submersible pump with a 16-gauge needle fitted at the end of the discharge hose.  The needle was pushed through a rubber stopper covering an acid-washed vacutainer that was first flushed with nitrogen gas to remove and oxygen, then evacuated with a vacuum pump to establish a negative pressure within the vacutainer.  Water samples were stored on ice and transported to the laboratory.  Samples were processed for total phosphorus using colorimetery following dry-oxidation/acid hydroloysis methods within 1 to 5 days following sample collection.  Salinity of the groundwater and surface water was determined at the time of sampling using an Orion S-C-T meter.  Total phosphorus concentrations in 11 groundwater wells ranged from 0.5 to 2.3 uM (16 to 73.6 ug/L-P).  Concentrations of total phosphorus in the overlying surface water were consistently lower and ranged from 0.16 to 0.45 uM (5.1 to 14.4 ug/L-P).  There was a strong positive correlation between total phosphorus concentrations in the groundwater with salinity (R2=0.6).  The results of this investigation indicate enhanced phosphorus concentrations within mixing zone groundwaters underlying the southern Everglades.  These concentrations exceed the expected values predicted by conservative mixing of local fresh groundwater and intruding seawater, which both have TP less than 1 uM." ;

    glview:description "American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) are top predators in the Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE), but their movement patterns and role in the ecosystem are largely unknown. Proposed restoration and management efforts in the Everglades are likely to influence both alligator movements and the spatiotemporal patterns of their effects on ecosystem and community dynamics, making studies of the factors influencing alligator movements important at this time. In October 2007, we initiated a study of alligators in the Shark River Slough of Everglades National Park using two tracking techniques that have yet to be used on crocodilians: GPS tracking and passive acoustic telemetry. GPS units attached to two alligators have provided 120 positions over a two month period while acoustic transmitters attached to 12 alligators have been detected 34,000 times on an array of 8 monitoring stations within the river system. GPS positions are more accurate than acoustic monitoring and can provide data over the entire range an alligator might move, but acoustic transmitters provide more temporally detailed information on movements within a monitoring array and over a longer duration (potentially years rather than months). Our preliminary results show that alligators may remain in localized areas for weeks at a time, but make long-distance moves from the mouth of the river system to the marsh-mangrove ecotone and likely into the marsh. In general, most alligators moved upstream as freshwater inputs decreased, but some individuals remained near the river mouth even when salinities were high. Ultimately, by characterizing alligator movements in relation to spatiotemporal variation in environmental factors we will be able to predict how alligator distributions and populations will respond to planned increases in freshwater flow. Furthermore, movement data combined with dietary and stable isotopic studies may shed light on the possible role of alligators in the redistribution of nutrients throughout the Shark River system." ;

Bulk parameters measured are d13C, C/N and %OC, while molecular characterizations are based on detailed biomarker analyses of extractable lipids and CP/MAS 13C-NMR of bulk OM.

    glview:description "This study examines temporal and spatial dynamics in the fish community of the oligohaline to mesohaline reaches of ecotonal creeks along the southwest region of Everglades National Park.  Sampling is conducted at 15 mangrove creeks in two drainages: Rookery Branch and the North, Roberts, and Watson rivers.  The sampling in Rookery Branch expands over a 12-km stretch of ecotonal mangrove creeks upstream of Tarpon Bay.  Minnow traps are used to target small-bodied forage fish.  Sampling started in the wet season of 2004, and has been conducted three times per year at these approximate times: November (wet season); February (transition); and April (dry season).  In the Rookery Branch region, fish abundance varies markedly yearly and seasonally. Catches peak in the drier months, reflecting a pulse of movement by freshwater taxa into creeks as marshes upstream dry.  The timing of this pulse is closely tied to the pattern of water recession in upstream marshes, and has important ramifications for wading bird prey availability." ;

    glview:description "Dissolved organic matter plays an important role in biogeochemical processes in aquatic environments such as elemental cycling, microbial loop energetics, and the transport of materials across landscapes.  Since most of N (> 90%) and P (around 90%) is in the organic form in the oligotrophic subtropical Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE), study of the source and dynamics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the ecosystem is crucial for the better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients.  FCE are composed of estuaries with distinct regions with different biogeochemical processes. Freshwater marsh primarily receives terrestrial input and local autochthonous vegetation production. Mangrove ecotone, nevertheless, is affected by the tidal contributions from Florida Bay and local mangrove production. Florida Bay (FB) is a wedge-shaped shallow oligotrophic estuary which lays south of the Everglades, the bottom of which is covered with a dense biomass of seagrass.  The sources of both freshwater and nutrients in FCE are difficult to quantify, owing to the non-point source nature of runoff from the Everglades and the dendritic cross channels in the mangroves.  Furthermore, the combination of multiple DOM sources (freshwater marsh vegetation, mangroves, phytoplankton, seagrass, etc.), and the potential seasonal variability of their relative contribution, along with the history of (photo)chemical and microbial diagenetic processing, and complex advective circulation, makes the study of DOM dynamics in FCE particularly difficult using standard schemes of estuarine ecology.  Quantitative information of DOM is very useful to investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DOM to a certain degree, however, qualitative information is necessary to better understand the source and dynamics of DOM.  Since fluorescence spectroscopic techniques are very sensitive, quick and simple, they have been applied to investigate the fate of DOM in estuaries." ;

    glview:description "Urban growth models have increasingly been used by planners and policy makers to visualize, organize, understand, and predict urban growth. However, these models reveal a wide disparity in their attention to policy factors. Some urban growth models capture few if any specific policy effects (e.g.,as model variables), while others integrate certain policies but not others. Since zoning policies are the most widely used form of land use control in the United States, their conspicuous absence from so many urban growth models is surprising. This research investigated the impacts of zoning on urban growth by calibrating and simulating a cellular automaton urban growth model, SLEUTH, under two conditions in a South Florida location. The first condition integrated restrictive agricultural zoning into SLEUTH, while the other ignored zoning data. Goodness of fit metrics indicate that including the agricultural zoning data improved model performance.

The sites were chosen to capture the transition from Spartina alterniflora to Spartina cynosuroides (site SCSA) and the transition from Spartina cynosuroides to Zizaniopsis miliacea (sites ZSC1 and ZSC2). The quadrats were established as permanent plots in October 2012 by placing PVC stakes along the creekbank at each site.  Plots were evenly spaced, but were not randomly located because the goal was to start with mixtures of vegetation in most of the plots, and vegetation was distributed in patches along the creekbanks. Therefore, these plots provide useful measures of vegetation change, but are not a random sample of the vegetation at the site. Plots will be replaced as needed in future years to replace any lost to disturbance. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set. This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts." ;

    glview:description "Understanding of how plant communities are organized and will respond to global changes requires an understanding of how plant species respond to multiple environmental gradients. We examined the mechanisms mediating the distribution patterns of tidal marsh plants along an estuarine gradient in Georgia using a combination of field transplant experiments and monitoring. Our results could not be fully explained by the “competition-to-stress hypothesis” (the current paradigm explaining plant distributions across estuarine landscapes). This hypothesis states that the upstream limits of plant distributions are determined by competition, and the downstream limits by abiotic stress. We found that competition was generally strong in freshwater and brackish marshes, and that conditions in brackish and salt marshes were stressful to freshwater marsh plants, results consistent with the competition-to-stress hypothesis. Four other aspects of our results, however, were not explained by the competition-to-stress hypothesis. First, several halophytes found the freshwater habitat stressful, and performed best (in the absence of competition) in brackish or salt marshes. Second, the upstream distribution of one species was determined by the combination of both abiotic and biotic (competition) factors. Third, marsh productivity (estimated by standing biomass) was a better predictor of relative biotic interaction intensity (RII) than was salinity or flooding, suggesting that productivity is a better indicator of plant stress than salinity or flooding gradients.

Imagery was  acquired for 97 bands from 435-950 nm at a 1 m spatial resolution. The bandwidths were preselected by investigators with CALMIT to to capture the photoplankton red reflectance feature and carotenoid and chlorophyll driven absorption behaviors. These data were acquired for the following purposes: 1) calculate suites of remote sensing phytoplankton indices, (2) produce algorithms for predicting plant and phytoplankton chlorophyll and accessory pigments and productivity, 3) assess water quality, and (4) perform atmospheric corrections." ;

Litter baskets were placed in both the blowdown and control plots in Sept 1989. TSB-13 was originally part of an AVIRIS overflight study and was not included in the data collections until 1990. The litterfall year begins approximately September 20 each year. Years are designated with the fall date, e.g., Sept 1989-Sept 1990 is the 1989 litter year. Litter was collected 2x/year (Nov and the following Sep) in 1989 and 1990 and 3x/year in all subsequent years (Nov, June and Sep). Baskets were removed from the blowdown plot in fall 1990 while the experimental manipulation was underway. Only control plot baskets were collected for the 1990-1991 litterfall year. Nov. 2005 and June 2006 are combined as early snow in Nov. 2005 precluded collection. Litter was not sorted by species in all years and in most cases only the Nov collections were sorted from 1989 through 1993, 2000 and 2006. In other years, a total unsorted litter weight for each basket was recorded. Unsorted litter is indicated as unsorted species type. Sample collections have been made through the 2007-2008 litterfall year." ;

No such plan for the hemlock woolly adelgid is currently available in the published literature. Two interrelated sampling strategies allow a researcher to enter a site and determine with a given level of probability whether or not an HWA infestation is present and the level of infestation.  A ground based sampling plan is also critical to the ‘ground truthing’ of aerial survey systems. A fully developed sampling plan requires relatively extensive datasets obtained over time, and may include the use of computer-generated data obtained through re-sampling techniques. The results obtained through the Harvard Forest Summer Research Program should provide a firm foundation for further development of an HWA sampling program. Data collection is on-going." ;

    glview:description "Allometric relationships exist between maximal mass-based net photosynthetic rates, leaf mass per unit area, and foliar Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) content, which hold across a diverse spectrum of over 2500 plant species worldwide.  Carnivorous plants depart from this spectrum because they dedicate substantial leaf area to capturing prey, from which they derive N and P under very nutrient-limiting situations. We conducted a manipulative feeding experiment to test whether morphological and physiological allometric relationships of carnivorous plants when nutrients are not limiting are more similar to allometric relationships of non-carnivorous plants.  We examined the effects of prey availability on photosynthetic rate (Amass), chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, architecture, and foliar nutrient and chlorophyll content of ten pitcher plant (Sarracenia) species.  We tested the hypothesis that increased prey availability would stimulate Amass of one or more leaves, increase photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUEN, PNUEP), increase relative biomass allocation to photosynthetically efficient, non-predatory phyllodes rather than pitchers, increase overall plant biomass, and reduce stress-related chlorophyll fluorescence.  This is the first multi-species, controlled feeding experiment using realistic prey treatments, measuring these physiological parameters directly, and elucidating mechanisms of nutrient stoichiometry and allometry in carnivorous plants.  Increased prey availability increased chlorophyll content, Amass and photosystem efficiency (the Fv/Fm ratio) across the 10 Sarracenia species. These increases were most evident in younger leaves, as older leaves rapidly translocated nutrients to newer, growing tissues.  Better-fed plants produced a significantly higher proportion of phyllodes than controls.  Higher prey availability was associated with lower N:P ratios, and a shift from P- to N-limitation.  PNUEP was significantly enhanced by supplementary feeding, whilst PNUEN was not.  Overall biomass and root:shoot ratios were unaffected by feedings.  Feeding shifted allometric relationships of P relative to Amass, N, and LMA from outside the third bivariate quartile to within the 50th bivariate percentile of the relationships found for non-carnivorous plants; other allometric relationships were unaffected.  Carnivorous plants can plastically shift phosphorus allometry when nutrients are plentiful, but are less flexible in terms of nitrogen and other ecophysiological parameters." ;

    glview:description "Available phylogenetic data illustrate that in all carnivorous lineages, the ancestral trap type is a sticky, flypaper-type trap (Ellison and Gotelli, 2001). In the Caryophyllales, pitfall traps (Nepenthes) and snap traps (Dionaea and Aldrovanda) are derived relative to the sticky pads of Drosera. Similarly, in the Lamiales, the sticky-leaved Pinguicula is ancestral to Genlisea with its eel (or lobster-pot) traps and Utricularia with its vacuum traps. In the Ericales, the Sarraceniaceae with its pitfall traps are derived relative to Roridula, another species with flypaper traps. Muller et al. (2004) hypothesed that carnivorous genera with rapidly evolving genomes (Genlisea and Utricularia) have more predictable and frequent captures of prey than do genera with more slowly evolving genomes; by extension it could be hypothesized that in general, carnivorous plants with more complex traps should have more predictable and frequent captures of prey than do those with relatively simple traps. Increases in predictability and frequency of prey capture could be achieved by evolving more elaborate mechanisms for attracting prey, by specializing on particular types of prey, or, as Darwin suggested, by specializing on particular (large) sizes of prey. In all cases, one would expect that prey actually captured would not be a random sample of the available prey. Furthermore, when multiple species of carnivorous plants co-occur, one would predict, again following Darwin that interspecific competition would lead to specialization on particular kinds of prey.  Because the traps of carnivorous plants accumulate identifiable remains of prey, analysis of trap contents can provide an aggregate record of the prey that have been successfully \"sampled\" by the plant. Such samples could be used to begin to test the hypothesis that carnivorous plant genera differ in prey composition and to look for evidence of specialization in prey capture. Over the past 80 years, numerous ecologists have gathered data on prey contents of carnivorous plants of a number of species and genera from around the world, but these data have never been summarized or synthesized; this summary and synthesis is accomplished in Ellison et al. (2008). The accompanying data are in this file." ;

    glview:description "The \"re-wilding\" of ecosystems with extirpated large mammals has become a focus of recent scientific and conservation initiatives; however, it is unclear how proposed re-introductions will influence systems that are often vastly different from those that occurred before these animals were extirpated.  Moose, the northeast’s largest Holocene browser, have recently expanded across southern New England’s temperate forest landscape after an absence of 200 years, realizing a natural re-wilding experiment.  Moose have been well-studied throughout the boreal forest biome; however, because they are rare today in temperate forests, almost nothing is known of their ecology, behavior, or potential impacts to these ecosystems.  This study investigated patterns of winter moose browse in order to: (1) gain insight into the likely influences of this herbivore on the vegetation patterns of the region; and (2) to identify the most important habitat features influencing moose winter foraging activity at a landscape and site scale.  Two large forested watersheds in Central Massachusetts were sampled for moose browse, habitat features, and disturbances including forest harvesting and human activity.  Chi-square and t-tests were used to identify browse species preferences of moose, and step-wise multiple regression was used to identify habitat variables that are strong predictors of browse intensity.  Hardwoods and hemlock were favored over white pine, and browse intensity was significantly and positively related to forest harvesting, elevation, swamps, and distance to human settlement.  The results from this study suggest that in the winter months, moose populations are concentrating in remote, elevated areas that are broken by swamps and have intensive forest harvests.  In areas that support high moose densities, selective browsing, particularly in regenerating harvests, could promote less favored species like white pine at the expense of hardwoods and hemlock.  The strong association between moose and forest harvesting indicates that recolonizing megafauna may interact with novel human conditions and disturbances to impact ecosystems differently than in the past.  Nonetheless, habitat loss and climate change may ultimately preclude the long-term viability of moose and its impacts to this region." ;

For details on methods and results, please see the published paper (Boose, E. R., M. I. Serrano and D. R. Foster.  2004.  Landscape and regional impacts of hurricanes in Puerto Rico.  Ecological Monographs 74: 335-352). The Abstract from the paper is reproduced below.  \"Puerto Rico is subject to frequent and severe impacts from hurricanes, whose long-term ecological role must be assessed on a scale of centuries.  In this study we applied a method for reconstructing hurricane disturbance regimes developed in an earlier study of hurricanes in New England.  Patterns of actual wind damage from historical records were analyzed for 85 hurricanes since European settlement in 1508.  A simple meteorological model (HURRECON) was used to reconstruct the impacts of 43 hurricanes since 1851.  Long-term effects of topography on a landscape scale in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) were simulated with a simple topographic exposure model (EXPOS).  \"Average return intervals across Puerto Rico for F0 damage (loss of leaves and branches) and F1 damage (scattered blowdowns, small gaps) on the Fujita scale were 4 and 6 years, respectively.  At higher damage levels a gradient was created by the direction of the storm tracks and the weakening of hurricanes over the interior mountains.  Average return intervals for F2 damage (extensive blowdowns) and F3 damage (forests leveled) ranged from 15 to 33 years and 50 to 150 years, respectively, from east to west.  In the LEF, the combination of steep topography and constrained peak wind directions created a complex mosaic of topographic exposure and protection, with average return intervals for F3 damage ranging from 50 years to more than 150 years.  Actual forest damage was strongly dependent on land-use history and the effects of recent hurricanes.  Annual and decadal timing of hurricanes varied widely.  There was no clear centennial-scale trend in the number of major hurricanes over the historical period.\"" ;

    glview:description "Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) is a common forest species that is declining throughout its range in the eastern United States because of the invasion of an exotic forest pest, Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid). This pest kills infected trees, and over time, infected stands are replaced by deciduous forests. The conversion of forests from Hemlock to deciduous species is predicted to impact the hydrology, chemistry, and biology of associated headwater streams. In this study, we examined the macroinvertebrate communities of two adjacent headwater streams with differing Hemlock influence in central Massachusetts. Abundance, taxa richness, diversity, and unique taxa were generally greater in the deciduous stream. Differences in the distribution of functional feeding groups were observed: the Hemlock stream had a greater percentage of collector-gatherers while the deciduous stream had a greater percentage of shredders and predators. These findings suggest that macroinvertebrate communities in streams draining Hemlock and deciduous watersheds may differ in structure and function, and that anticipated Hemlock mortality may impact the region’s stream ecology." ;

    glview:description "As the ecological functioning of a forest stand is often related to the spatial organization of the canopy, we used a portable canopy LiDAR (PCL; Parker et al. 2004) to measure volumetric canopy structure in the simulated HWA management treatments.  In September and October 2005, prior to leaf abscission, we set up 16 parallel transects spaced 2 meters apart in the 900 m2 (30 x 30 m) interior of each of the eight treatment plots. The orientation of the transects were either north-south or east-west to minimize the difficulty of traversing the stand. The distances to canopy surfaces more than1 m above the ground along the transects were recorded with the PCL. Assuming a constant horizontal sampling rate, the continual height measures were binned into 1 m intervals.  From these measures, vertical canopy profiles, canopy openness, canopy rugosity, and other metrics related to the three-dimensional structure of the canopy can be derived.  These canopy measures will be repeated minimally at 5 and 15 year intervals to develop an understanding of early structural dynamics and micrometeorological consequences associated with the simulated HWA treatments.

    glview:description "Forest harvesting is one of the most significant disturbances affecting forest plant composition and structure in Western Massachusetts, yet few studies have quantified the effects of harvesting in this region. Massachusetts requires all commercial harvest operations above 87 m3 to file a Forest Cutting Plan (FCP) with the state. We have digitized these FCPs (see McDonald et al. 2006), covering all harvests from 1984 to 2003. Our study area is Massachusetts west of the coastal basin, as defined by Motts and O’Brian (1981). We selected 126 sites for sampling. Two-thirds of the sites (89) were harvested once between 1984 and 2003, and these were selected randomly from the larger FCP database. The remaining one-third of the sites (37) were control sites selected randomly from all unharvested forest in the study area. The boundaries for our field surveys were those filed with the FCP for harvested sites, and were circular for control sites, proportional in size to the mean FCP in the physiographic region (Motts and O'Brien 1981): Connecticut River Valley (10.7 ha), Central Upland (11.3 ha), Berkshire Valley and Taconic Mountains (12.6 ha), and the Western Upland (15.9 ha). Note that our sampled sites were well-dispersed over the study area, and encompassed the variety of past agricultural land-use." ;

Excluding Maine, where the northern forest region was never settled and remained forested, the states share a common history of deforestation for agriculture followed by farm abandonment and natural reforestation.

    glview:description "Terrestrial salamanders are significant contributors to the overall vertebrate biomass in a forest (Burton and Likens 1975a).   Due to this abundance, they are ecologically important as both predators of soil fauna, and as prey for larger animals such as birds, reptiles, and small mammals (Welsh and Droege 2001).  In 1997, the invasive insect pest, hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) or HWA, was discovered on Hemlock Hill at Harvard University’s Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.  Unfortunately, this infestation has led to the death, decline, and removal of a larger percentage of the eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) trees in this section of the Arboretum.  In April 2004, researchers from the Harvard Forest and the Arnold Arboretum began studying the environmental impacts of this disturbance event (HF061).  To complement this research twenty-four artificial cover objects (ACOs) were installed in three plots on Hemlock Hill in the summer of 2004 to monitor the relative abundance of eastern red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) and any other herpetofauna encountered.  The timing of the installation permitted an analysis of the effects of a logging treatment conducted in the winter of 2004-2005 on the relative abundance of terrestrial salamanders.  Logging had an immediate impact on the relative abundance of eastern red-backed salamanders in both logged plots as seen by an 83 percent decline in the relative abundance of red-backs in plot 1 and a 63 percent decline in plot 2 in the spring following logging versus the fall prior to logging.  In the unlogged control plot (plot 3) the relative abundance declined 9 percent in the spring versus the fall.  The lower relative abundances in the logged plots were likely due to higher temperatures on the surface of the soil (5.7 deg C) and five centimeters below the soil surface (1.2 deg C), and lower relative humidity on the surface of the soil (3.4%) than in the unlogged plot.  By Fall 2005, the relative abundance of red-backs had nearly recovered in plot 2 with only a 7% decline from Fall 2004, compared to a 15% increase in the control plot.  However, in plot 1 the relative abundance of red-backs declined further in Fall 2005 with 94% fewer salamanders than in Fall 2004.  These differences are likely because plot 1 is on a steeper slope leading to less retention of moisture and higher levels of sunlight reaching the forest floor than plot 2.  This physical difference led to plot 1 having higher temperatures on the surface of the soil, higher soil temperatures, and lower relative humidity on the surface of the soil than plot 2.  In addition to the 147 Eastern Red-back Salamander observations, twelve American Toad (Bufo americanus), three Northern Dusky Salamander (Desmognathus fuscus), and one Garter Snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) observation were made under ACOs.  It is important to point out that many repeat observations were likely made, and that 147 observations does not suggest 147 unique red-backs observed.  Of the Eastern Red-backed Salamanders observed 40% were leadback morphs and 60% were red-back morphs.  This is a higher percentage of leadback morphs than in any of the 50 Eastern Red-backed Salamander populations in New England studied by Lotter and Scott (1977), and more similar to the percentages seen in populations in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio.  Interestingly, Lotter and Scott found that the frequency of leadback morphs is positively correlated with warmer climates.  All three Northern Dusky Salamander observations were made under ACO 6 in plot 1 in 2004, and this species was not observed again in 2005.   The Garter Snake observation was made in 2005 under ACO 10 in plot 2.  The relative abundance of red-backs in the control plot was higher than in any of the thirty second-growth eastern hemlock-dominated and mixed deciduous forests studied by the author during the same period in 2005.  However, this may be more a reflection of a lower abundance of coarse woody debris on the forest floor of Hemlock Hill than in the unmanaged forests studied in north central Massachusetts than an actual higher relative abundance of salamanders.  That is, fewer pieces of coarse woody debris would mean fewer natural cover objects for salamanders, thereby making ACOs more attractive.  Evidence that natural cover objects were less abundant at the Arboretum than in north central Massachusetts was the much higher frequency of multiple red-backs observed under the same ACO.  Two red-backs were observed under an ACO in 5% of observations at the Arboretum versus 0.6% of observations in north central Massachusetts, three observations were made under the same ACO in 2% of observations versus 0.08%, and four or more observations were made in 1% of observations versus 0%.  The Arnold Arboretum has a long history of breeding bird studies spanning from 1895 to 2005 which have allowed researchers to track changes in species composition over more than a century (Mayer 2005).  Similarly, the baseline data provided here will hopefully be used by future studies to assess potential changes in the relative abundance of terrestrial herpetofauna on Hemlock Hill at the Arnold Arboretum as it undergoes significant vegetative changes due to HWA infestation.  Another interesting question that future research will be able to assess is whether the percentage of leadback morphs in the population changes over time, given the potential changes in climate.  In the future hopefully other areas of the Arboretum will be studied as well including the woods to the west of the Bradley Collection of Rosaceous Plants where spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) could be breeding in the adjacent ponds, and Bussey Brook and the stream running through the Meadow which may provide habitat for northern two-lined salamanders (Eurycea bislineata)." ;

We measured forest communities in six sites that were formerly plowed, pastured, or continuously forested woodlots in Prospect Hill to test predictions about species composition, stand structure, and productivity in response to agricultural land use legacies.  A permanent 30 x 50 m plot gridded in 5 x 5 m sub-plots was established in each of the 6 sites. All trees at least 2.5 cm DBH (diameter at breast height, 1.3 m) were mapped visually in the field, marked with an aluminum tag, and their DBH recorded in summer 1996. Individual boles of multi-stemmed trees were measured separately and a composite single DBH was calculated. Standing dead trees were also mapped and their DBH recorded as well. The 1996 data were used to determine above ground woody biomass using allometric equations for individual trees.  The permanent plots were re-surveyed ten years later in fall 2006. The status of each tree mapped in 1996 was recorded (alive, dead standing, dead fallen, forked) and DBH’s were re-measured. Additional trees that grew across the 2.5 cm DBH threshold during the ten-year period were mapped and their DBH’s measured. Composite diameters and above ground woody biomass were determined for forked trees as in 1996.  The 2006 re-measurements were used to analyze changes in species composition, stand structure (density, diameter distribution), and mortality patterns among species and size classes, and to calculate net changes in above ground woody biomass across the ten-year period." ;

    glview:description "Ambient CO2 concentrations in terrestrial ecosystems vary substantially on several spatial and temporal scales as numerous soil, plant, and atmospheric processes respond to irradiance, temperature, moisture and wind. There is one widespread microhabitat in terrestrial ecosystems, the nearground zone, in which CO2 is naturally enhanced above average background levels. CO2 produced by soil respiration diffuses through the litter and boundary layers and dissipates fairly rapidly into the overlying bulk air. However, a marked vertical profile of nearground enriched CO2 (hereafter NEC) is usually present in the first 0-50 cm above ground. The degree of enrichment varies primarily with soil respiration rate and turbulent mixing, secondarily with photosynthesis by plants in the herbaceous stratum, and usually shows marked diel and seasonal variation. References to this CO2 \"subsidy\" and its effects on plants have occurred occasionally in the literature since 1939, but there have been few detailed studies of either the nearground profile or plant responses in the field, particularly for species that consistently occupy the nearground stratum.  Considerable research over the last twenty years in both controlled and field environments has shown that co-occurring plant species may respond differently to artificially elevated CO2.  But in contrast to light, temperature, water, and nutrients, plant community ecologists have generally not considered CO2 among the factors that regulate species’ distribution and abundance, except indirectly as it may affect water balance.  We have documented differences in forest composition (woody and herbaceous), soil characteristics, microclimates, and nearground CO2 levels among six sites that were formerly plowed, pastured, or continuously forested woodlots in Prospect Hill. We selected three perennial herbaceous species (Aralia nudicaulis, wild sarsaparilla; Clintonia borealis, blue-bead lily; Medeola virginiana, Indian cucumber root) and two dominant tree species in the Harvard Forest system (Acer rubrum, red maple; Quercus rubra (northern red oak) and measured their photosynthetic light responses to ambient CO2 variation within the range commonly encountered in the field (350-450 ppm) to address five questions: (1) What is the overall effect of NEC on net carbon assimilation? (2) Do species differ overall (land use sites combined) in their responses to NEC? (3) Do the land use sites differ overall (species combined) in plant responses to NEC? (4) Are there site x CO2 or species x CO2 interactions in response to NEC?  Light response curves were measured at three CO2 levels (350, 400, and 450 ppm inside the cuvette) on 3 randomly-selected, healthy replicates of each species in each of the three sites, generating a total of  135 curves. Gas-exchange measurements were made with a LI-6400 infrared gas analyzer (Li-Cor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) during ~7:30-12:30 a.m. solar time in late July and early August 1998. The analyzer was calibrated daily just prior to measurements. Air temperature in the cuvette was maintained at 23 deg C (mean morning air temperature in the sites), and relative humidity was maintained at either constant or slowly rising levels (typically less than 5% increase overall) during the 20-25 minutes required for each curve.  Rectangular hyperbolic curves were fitted to the scatterplots and curve parameters (daytime respiration rate, Rday; apparent quantum efficiency, AQE;  maximum assimilation rate, Amax;  curve convexity; light compensation point, LCP; and light saturation point, Lsat) were estimated using Photosyn Assistant software v. 1.1 (Dundee Scientific, Dundee, Scotland, UK). Six of the curves produced questionable parameters in the quantum yield region and were excluded from further analyses, leaving a total sample size of 129." ;

The occurrence of vascular taxa was recorded in each of the 60 5 m x 5 m contiguous plots within the 30 m x 50 m permanently gridded study plot in each land use legacy site in June 1996. Identification was made to species in most cases.  Woodlots showed higher average species richness at the site level (53) than either pastured (52 species) or plowed (49) sites. However woodlots also show greater spatial variation in richness at the 5 m x 5 m resolution than either the plowed or pastured sites (in that order) as represented by the range, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. Seasonally-averaged light levels at 50 cm are approximately twice as high in the plowed and pastured sites as in the woodlots, but the woodlots show significantly greater soil organic matter, carbon, nitrogen and water-holding capacity than the post-agricultural sites. These results suggest that soil resources may be more important than light in fostering higher herbaceous stratum richness. However, woodlot richness is also affected by the presence of taxa that are slow to re-colonize heavily disturbed sites (e.g., Epigaea repens) and to distinctive microsites that are less common in the plowed or pastured sites in the Harvard Forest system (e.g., exposed boulders). The greater spatial variation in woodlot richness is strongly influenced by both substrate diversity and by scattered hemlock trees, which substantially depress the herb stratum in localized patches." ;

    glview:description "Soil respiration, including both CO2 produced during decomposition of organic matter in soil and surface litter, and CO2 produced during respiration of living roots, is a major component of forest-atmosphere carbon exchange, typically comprising 60 to 80% of whole-forest respiration.  Soil respiration data can explain a major part of a forest ecosystem’s response to changing climate, and help in evaluating the accuracy of nighttime eddy flux data as estimates of whole-ecosystem respiration measurements.  Soil respiration in the footprint areas of the Harvard Forest Hemlock and Little Prospect Hill eddy flux towers has shown generally similar responses to soil temperature and precipitation as soil respiration near the EMS flux tower (see data set HF006), but also some differences.  Soil respiration at the Hemlock tower site has been lower than at the other tower sites during very wet summer weather, but higher during dry summer periods.  Average estimated annual total soil respiration has been close to the same for all three tower footprint areas, however.  There has been some evidence of lower soil respiration in the parts of the Little Prospect Hill tower footprint with lowest soil moisture (those with a high slope position, 100 m from the tower), as compared with other sites during very dry summer periods, but such periods have been very rare during the period of data collection.  Soil respiration measured near the  Little Prospect Hill tower in summer has also been higher than ecosystem respiration as estimated from nighttime carbon flux measured by an eddy covariance system.  This indicates that during some nighttime periods, CO2 is being removed from the volume of air below the eddy flux system by a route other than through the top of the forest canopy near the flux tower, possibly by downslope advection, even under conditions when it initially appeared that atmospheric turbulence was high enough to prevent removal of CO2 by these other mechanisms." ;

Soil water content is of particular interest and importance in explaining patterns of soil respiration (including root respiration) and ecosystem respiration, 60 to 75% of which occurs below the ground surface at Harvard Forest.  Soil water content in deciduous forest near the Little Prospect Hill Forest was in general found to be more variable than near the Hemlock tower.  One influence contributing to this is the presence of a water table within 1 m of the soil surface near the hemlock tower, compared to a water table at unknown depth in the deeply drained soils in most parts of Little Prospect Hill.  Relatively low evapotranspiration at the Hemlock tower site during the period when deciduous trees are foliated also contributes to higher water content in soil there, and a relatively thick surface organic layer.  These influences tend to maintain soil respiration at higher levels in the hemlock forest during dry summers, but excessive moisture in the soil at the Hemlock site during very wet summers appears to suppress soil respiration." ;

    glview:description "A collaborative research network (“PhenoCam”) to provide automated \"near\" remote sensing of canopy phenology across the northeastern US and adjacent Canada has been initiated. A pilot study (2006-2007) at the Bartlett Experimental Forest previously demonstrated the viability of tracking both spring green-up and autumn senescence based on relative changes in red, green, and blue (RGB) color channel brightness values extracted from networked digital camera (“webcam”) images. In 2008, we installed commercial-grade digital webcams at a dozen established research sites across the northeast, from Ontario and New York across to Maine, with most sites concentrated within a few degrees of 45 deg N. Two additional Midwestern sites were subsequently added to the network.  At seven camera sites (Bartlett, Howland, Harvard Forest, Groundhog River, Chibougamau, University of Michigan Biological Station, and Morgan Monroe State Forest), ongoing measurements of carbon and water fluxes are being made with the eddy covariance method, which will enable us to directly link phenology to seasonal variation in ecosystem processes. The seasonal trajectory of a “greenness index” for Harvard Forest shows a rapid rise in greenness in spring (coinciding with ground observations of budburst), a gentle decline over the course of the summer, and then a rapid decline with autumn senescence.  This network is providing a very rich (and unique) dataset on spatial and temporal patterns of canopy phenology in the across this region. Half hourly images are uploaded to a project web page (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu), which also features additional information about the project, including a protocol for camera deployment, download tools (so that the imagery is available to a wider community), site locations and contact information, etc. Image processing routines are under development. Time series of greenness will be added to the archive when this is complete; at present, only images are being made available." ;

    glview:description "Ecologists have long recognized that coexistence of interacting species depends on a diversity of separate, but linked habitats. Most models of species coexistence treat these habitat \"patches\" as unchanging elements of the landscape, but in reality, they are constantly changing in size and shape. The structure and dynamics of the food webs that inhabit them both control and depend on these changes. In this five-year (2006-2011) collaborative project, we are using a combination of extensive field surveys and intensive field experiments to understand how species interactions change the spatial distribution of dynamic habitat patches across the landscape, and to determine how food webs are structured within and among these patches. The experimental system for this five-year research project is the Sarracenia \"microecosystem\": the northern pitcher-plant Sarracenia purpurea; the unique food web of bacteria, protozoa, rotifers, mites, and fly larvae that live within its rainwater-filled leaves; three species of bog-inhabiting ants that are the primary prey for this carnivorous plant; and larvae of the pitcher-plant moth, Exyra fax, which cut and drain pitchers and remove food web habitat. Results from surveys of bogs in all six New England state and field experiments conducted at bogs at Harvard Forest and Belchertown, Massachusetts will be used to parameterize a simulation model to predict changes in spatial structure of ant, moth, and plant populations, and the structure and composition of the aquatic food web associated with the plant.

    glview:description "Forests typically respond to nitrogen additions with increased productivity, hence a long-held paradigm was that chronic additions of anthropogenically-derived atmospheric deposition  would have positive ecosystem effects.  However, twenty years of work at the Harvard Forest Chronic N Deposition plots, and in other forest ecosystems as well, has shown that that this simplistic view is incomplete.   For example, enhanced ammonium uptake increases soil acidity, leading to mobilization of aluminum, and loss of nutrient cations (e.g.  Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+ ) all of which influence root mass, turnover, and activity.  To address long-term impacts of N additions on forest root mass, we removed O-horizon (forest floor) samples from the Chronic N hardwood and red pine stands to quantify the total mass of roots.  We found that long term N additions had contrasting results in the two forests.  In the hardwood plots, total root mass (less than 2mm) increased from 0.167 + 0.026 (S.E.) kg m-2 in the control plot to 0.434 + 0.170 kg m-2 in the high N plots.  In contrast, in the red pine stand, roots declined from 0.074 + 0.011 (S.E.) kg m-2 in the control plot to 0.031 + 0.016 kg m-2 in the high N plots.  These data are in agreement with data for aboveground productivity at the Chronic N plots, which show stimulated growth in the hardwoods and severe growth declines and enhanced mortality in the pine stand." ;

    glview:description "Ecological communities show great variation in species richness, composition and food web structure across similar and diverse ecosystems.   Knowledge of how this biodiversity relates to ecosystem functioning is important for understanding the maintenance of diversity and the potential effects of species losses or gains on ecosystems. While research often focuses on how variation in species richness influences ecosystem processes, assessing species richness in a food web context can provide further insight into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and provide potential mechanisms underpinning this relationship.  Here, we assessed how species richness and trophic diversity affect decomposition rates in a complete aquatic food web:  the five trophic level web that occurs within water-filled leaves of the northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. We identified a trophic cascade in which top-predators - larvae of the pitcher-plant mosquito - indirectly increased bacterial decomposition by preying on bactivorous protozoa. Our data also revealed a facultative relationship in which larvae of the pitcher-plant midge increased bacterial decomposition by shredding detritus. These important interactions occur only in food webs with high trophic diversity, which in turn only occurs in food webs with high species richness. We show that species richness and trophic diversity underlie strong linkages between food web structure and dynamics that influence ecosystem functioning. The importance of trophic diversity and species interactions in determining how biodiversity relates to ecosystem functioning suggests that simply focusing on species richness does not give a complete picture as to how ecosystems may change with the loss or gain of species." ;

    glview:description "For details on methods and results, please see the published paper (Motzkin, G., D. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod and R. D. Boone. 1996. Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain. Ecological Monographs 66: 345-365). The Abstract from the paper is reproduced below.  \"The widespread and long-lasting impact of human activity on natural eco-systems indicates that land-use history must be treated as an integral aspect of ecological study and a critical component of conservation planning. The New England landscape has undergone a complete transformation as forests were converted to agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries followed by succession to woodland as a result of widespread agricultural abandonment. Despite the prevalence of human impacts, the effect and longevity of land-use practices on modern forest conditions are poorly understood. In the present study of pitch pine - scrub oak vegetation on a sand plain in the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts, we address the following questions: (1) what is the relative importance of human and natural disturbance and environmental factors in controlling vegetation composition, structure, and landscape patterns; (2) what are the mechanisms underlying human impacts on vegetation, and what is the duration of these impacts; and (3) what are the implications of land-use history for the interpretation and conservation of these communities? Sand plain vegetation was selected for investigation because the homogeneity of site conditions facilitates the interpretation of land-use and natural disturbance impacts, and because the uncommon vegetation and constituent species are priorities for conservation efforts.  \"Paleoecological data suggest that pre-European fires were common on the study area, perhaps ignited by a large regional Indian population. The area was noted historically as an extensive pine plain and was used for wood products from the 18th to the mid-19th century. Eighty-two percent of the area was subsequently plowed for agriculture before being abandoned in the early 20th century.  \"Soil analyses confirm the homogeneity of site conditions and suggest that land uses (plowing, woodlot/pasture) were determined according to ownership pattern rather than site factors. Previously cultivated parcels have distinct Ap (plow horizons) 15 - 33 cm deep, whereas uncultivated parcels have A horizons 3 - 10 cm in depth. Soil physical and chemical characteristics are similar among land uses and modern vegetation types.  \"Aerial photographs document a dramatic transformation in plant cover over the last 50 yr. In 1939, the vegetation was grassland or shrub-heath (49%), open-canopy forest (29%), and scrub-oak shrublands (15%). In 1985, 73% of the study area was forested with pitch pine (40%), hardwood (12%), or mixed stands (21%), 9% was in open-canopy stands, and 3% was covered by grass or shrubs.  \"Vegetation/land-use relations are striking. Pitch pine occurs almost exclusively (97%) on former plowed sites, whereas scrub oak stands occur preferentially (89%) on sites that have not been plowed. Land use explains the greatest variation in modern vegetation as well as the distribution and abundance of many taxa. Fire has been common across the study area but has influenced vegetation largely within patterns resulting from prior land use. Land-use patterns and factors controlling vegetation composition and structure are broadly paralleled at similar sites elsewhere in the Connecticut Valley.  \"The study indicates that conservation biologists interested in preserving species, communities, and landscape patterns on sand plains in the northeastern United States need to incorporate a dynamic perspective of biological systems that includes the overriding impact of prior land use. In order to appreciate, study, and display these land-use and vegetation patterns it is essential to conserve the mosaic of assemblages and historical uses within a landscape setting.\"" ;

    glview:description "The existence and causes of abrupt transitions, thresholds, or regime shifts between ecosystem states is of great concern because the likelihood of such transitions is predicted to increase. The science for measuring and responding to state changes, however, is not well developed. This limitation stems from a lack of data-supported case studies of abrupt transitions in all but a few well-studied ecosystems. We used 30-60 years of data on biological responses and putative drivers from ocean, coastal, polar, and dryland ecosystems to illustrate general approaches to analysis of abrupt transitions. The analyses indicate one case in which the state or response variable (krill abundance) tracked abrupt changes in the driver (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) in a linear fashion. Response variables in other cases (sea cucumber abundance, penguin abundance, and perennial grass production) exhibited hysteretic relationships to drivers (wave intensity, sea ice duration, and monsoonal rainfall amounts, respectively) through a variety of response mechanisms. The analyses illustrate that 1) a suite of common concepts and approaches can be used across disparate systems, 2) there are generally insufficient data for the use of leading indicators, particularly considering the abruptness of transition relative to the lifespan of long-lived organisms, 3) information on spatiotemporal context is useful for comparing transitions in similar systems, and 4) ancillary information from associated experiments and observations is critical for interpreting response-driver relationships." ;

Inorganic nitrogen outputs from the litter loaves were monitored for 20 months using ion-exchange resins, removing and replacing the resins three times at 5 - 8 month intervals. Results indicated that there were differences between the control hemlock and deciduous loaves - NO3 and NH4 availability were higher in deciduous stands. However, the transfer of litter loaves from one stand type to another did not reveal changes in nutrient availability due to a shift in habitat. Rather, the methodology of moving litter loaves to a new site caused greater changes in nutrient availability, particularly over the summer months." ;

    glview:description "Two of the major results of our original soil warming study were that: (1) warming stimulated the decay of a labile soil carbon pool; and (2) it also increased the availability of inorganic nitrogen to plants.  Because of the small size of the original warming plots an important question we have not been able to answer conclusively is: Has the increase in available nitrogen led to an increase in carbon storage in the vegetation? And if yes, how much? In a systems context an additional question is: What is the balance between the carbon lost from the soil and the carbon stored in the vegetation in response to soil warming?  We are now addressing these important questions with a new warming experiment in the Barre Woods area of the Harvard Forest.  The Barre Woods site was chosen because it is of similarities to the Prospect Hill site - stand age, tree species composition, and soil type.  There is no evidence of a plow horizon at the Barre Woods site, though surrounding stone walls indicate past use as pastureland.  Historical records indicate the site was destroyed during the 1938 hurricane and then regrew naturally.  During the summer and fall of 2001 we buried 3.4 miles of heating cable in a 30 x 30m plot.  Cables were buried at a 10cm depth, spaced 20cm apart.  A second 30 x 30m area was delineated to serve as the control plot.  Results from the original soil warming experiment confirmed that the soil disturbance associated with the installation of heating cables has had no effect on soil temperatures and only minor and variable impacts on soil moisture.  In April 2002, we began a one-year period of baseline measurements before turning on the heat in the new megaplot.  These measurements included nitrogen mineralization, trace gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O), tree growth (dendrometer bands), an under story species survey, canopy foliage analysis (C:N, NIR), and lysimetry.  Thermistors were installed in both plots to begin tracking soil temperatures.  The baseline measurements have confirmed that there are no significant differences between the two plots for key ecosystem processes prior to the initiation of the warming manipulation.  We will turn on the power in April 2003 to begin the \"manipulation phase\" of this study.  From this study, we expect to determine whether or not warming results in the movement of nitrogen from the soil to the trees and to learn how this movement affects the net carbon balance of the ecosystem." ;

    glview:description "The susceptibility of a site to invasion by nonnative species depends on its current ecological features and its historical land use. Certain environments might be more conducive to an invasive plant’s success, and several recent studies have shown that former agricultural sites are more susceptible to invasion than sites that have been continuously wooded. We studied the invasive herb garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), in two regions with distinct ecological characteristics (the Connecticut River Valley and the Housatonic River Valley in Massachusetts), and two historical land uses (wooded versus cleared in 1830). We surveyed the presence and absence of garlic mustard in randomly selected 100 x 25 m forested sites along road edges and determined 1830 land use from historical records.  A significantly (p less than10^-10) higher proportion of the random survey sites contained garlic mustard in the Housatonic River Valley than in the Connecticut River Valley, while there was only a marginally significant (p=.057) difference in garlic mustard presence among sites with different 1830 land use. Among sites that contained garlic mustard - both random survey sites and 9 previously known sites - ANOVA showed that land use history, but not ecoregion, was a significant determining factor in the amount of garlic mustard present, with bigger populations in sites that were open in 1830. Thus, the ecoregion appears to primarily determine the number of sites colonized, while land use history determines performance within colonized sites. This suggests that for garlic mustard, the role of 1830 land use is not in facilitating initial establishment, but in serving as a cause or indicator of environmental quality for proliferation of the invasion. It also suggests that mechanisms of dispersal may differ in the two regions. Further studies should be conducted to determine what aspects of ecology and historical land use are relevant the success of garlic mustard." ;

    glview:description "The distributions of many organisms are spatially autocorrelated, but it is unclear whether including spatial terms in species distribution models (SDMs) improves projections of future species distributions. We provide the first comparative test of a purely spatial SDM, a purely non-spatial SDM, and an SDM that combines spatial and environmental information. Spatial SDMs provided better fits to the calibration data, more accurate predictions of a hold-out validation data set of modern trees, and lower false positive rates at all time periods than non-spatial SDMs. Hindcasted projection of spatial SDMs had higher variance than those of non-spatial SDMs. Overall predictive performance of non-spatial and spatial SDMs varied temporally and as a function of niche overlap. Ecological modelers should include spatial terms in SDMs used for projecting future distributions of species." ;

Location  The eight study sites are located in southern New England in the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The sites span a climatic and vegetational gradient from the lowland areas of eastern Massachusetts and Connecticut to the uplands of north-central and western Massachusetts. Tsuga canadensis and Fagus grandifolia are abundant in the upland area, while Quercus, Carya and Pinus species have higher abundances in the lowlands.    Methods  We collected sediment cores from three lakes in eastern and north-central Massachusetts (Berry East, Blood and Little Royalston Ponds). Pollen records from those sites were compared with previously published pollen data from five other sites. Multivariate data analysis (non-metric multi-dimensional scaling) was used to compare the pollen spectra of these sites through time.    Results  Our analyses revealed a sequence of vegetational responses to climate changes occurring across southern New England during the past 14,000 calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal yr BP). Pollen assemblages at all sites were dominated by Picea and Pinus banksiana between 14,000 and 11,500 cal yr BP; by Pinus strobus from 11,500 to 10,500 cal yr BP; and by P. strobus and Tsuga between 10,500 and 9500 cal yr BP. At 9500-8000 cal yr BP, however, vegetation composition began to differentiate between lowland and upland sites. Lowland sites had higher percentages of Quercus pollen, whereas Tsuga abundance was higher at the upland sites. This spatial heterogeneity strengthened between 8000 and 5500 cal yr BP, when Fagus became abundant in the uplands and Quercus pollen percentages increased further in the lowland records. The differentiation of upland and lowland vegetation zones remained strong during the mid-Holocene Tsuga decline (5500-3500 cal yr BP), but the pattern weakened during the late-Holocene (3500-300 cal yr BP) and European-settlement intervals. Within-group similarity declined in response to the uneven late-Holocene expansion of Castanea, while between-group similarity increased due to homogenization of the regional vegetation by forest clearance and ongoing disturbances.    Main conclusions  The regional gradient of vegetation composition across southern New England was first established between 9500 and 8000 cal yr BP. The spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation may have arisen at that time in response to the development or strengthening of the regional climatic gradient. Alternatively, the differentiation of upland and lowland vegetation types may have occurred as the climate ameliorated and an increasing number of species arrived in the region, arranging themselves in progressively more complex vegetation patterns across relatively stationary environmental gradients. The emergence of a regional vegetational gradient in southern New England may be a manifestation of the increasing number of species and more finely divided resource gradient." ;

Declines in organic content and peaks in the abundance of Isoetes spores indicate reduced water depth at 2900-2600, 2200-1800, and 1200-800 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), generally consistent with the timing of dry conditions in records from elsewhere in the northeastern United States. The Little Pond pollen record features little change over the last 3000 yr, indicating that the surrounding vegetation was relatively insensitive to these periods of drought. The 1200-800 cal yr BP dry interval, however, coincides with increased abundance of Castanea pollen, suggesting that the expansion of Castanea in southern New England may have been influenced by late-Holocene climatic variability." ;

    glview:description "Analyses of pollen, charcoal, and organic content in a lake-sediment core from Wildwood Lake, Long Island, New York, provide insights into the ecological and environmental history of this region.  The early-Holocene interval of the record (~9800-8800 cal. a BP) indicates the presence of Pinus rigida-Quercus ilicifolia woodlands with high fire activity.  A layer of sandy sediment dating to 9200 cal. a BP may reflect a brief period of reduced water depth, consistent with widespread evidence for cold, dry conditions at that time.  Two other sandy layers, bracketed by 14C dates, represent a sedimentary hiatus from ~8800 to 4500 cal. a BP.  This discontinuity may reflect the removal of some sediment during brief periods of reduced water depth at 5300 and 4600 cal. a BP.  In the upper portion of the record (before 4500 cal. a BP), subtle changes at ~3000 cal. a BP indicate declining prevalence of Quercus-Fagus-Carya forests and increasing abundance of Pinus rigida, perhaps due to reduced summer precipitation.  Elevated percentages of herbaceous taxa in the uppermost sediments represent European agricultural activities.  However, unlike charcoal records from southern New England, fire activity does not increase dramatically with European settlement.  These findings indicate that present-day Pinus rigida-Quercus ilicifolia woodlands on eastern Long Island are not a legacy of recent, anthropogenic disturbances." ;

Anticipating the potential effects of changes in species distributions requires models capable of forecasting population spread across realistic, heterogeneous landscapes and subject to spatiotemporal variability in habitat suitability. Several decades of theory and model development, as well as increased computing power and availability of fine-resolution GIS data, now make such models possible. This R code allows simulation of the spread of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA, Adelges tsugae) under climatic conditions experienced from December of 1951 until March of 2009. The code describes a spatially explicit stochastic model that combines dynamic dispersal and population processes with fine-resolution maps characterizing spatiotemporal heterogeneity in winter temperature and hemlock abundance to model range expansion of HWA. The model is parameterized using multi-year datasets describing population and dispersal dynamics of HWA and is applied to eastern North America." ;

    glview:description "The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), has spread rapidly across the eastern USA since its introduction from Japan 60 years ago, causing widespread mortality of both eastern hemlock [Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere] and Carolina hemlock [Tsuga caroliniana Engelm. (Pinaceae)]. Although HWA spread patterns have been repeatedly analyzed at regional scales, comparatively little is known about its dispersal potential within and between hemlock stands. As the small size and clonal nature of HWA make it nearly impossible to identify the source populations of dispersing individuals, we simulated intrastand HWA movement in the field by monitoring the movement of clumps of fluorescent powder that are slightly larger than HWA, but much easier to detect in the forest understory. Using three hemlock trees with three colors of fluorescent powder as source populations, we detected dispersal events at the farthest distances within our trapping array (400 m). However, more than 90% of dispersal events were less than 25 m. Dispersal patterns were similar from all three source trees and the distribution of dispersal distances in all cases could be described by lognormal probability density functions with mean dispersal distance of 12-14 m, suggesting that dispersal was relatively independent of location of source trees. In general, we documented tens of thousands of passive dispersal events in the forest understory despite the presence of a dense forest canopy. Thus, even under relatively light-wind conditions, particles of similar dimensions to HWA are capable of intra-stand movement, suggesting that a large population of HWA could rapidly infest other trees within several hundred meter radius, or beyond." ;

    glview:description "This study examined landscape-scale forest dynamics in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (Puerto Rico). The analysis was based on vegetation maps created from aerial photographs taken in 1936 and 1989.  For details on methods and results, please see the published paper (Foster, D. R., M. Fluet and E. R. Boose. 1999. Human or natural disturbance: landscape-scale dynamics of the tropical forests of Puerto Rico. Ecological Applications 9: 555-572). The Abstract from the paper is reproduced below.  \"Increasingly ecologists are recognizing that human disturbance has played an important role in tropical forest history and that many assumptions concerning the relative importance of natural processes warrant re-examination. To assess the historical role of broad-scale human versus natural disturbance on an intensively studied tropical forest we undertook a landscape-level analysis of forest dynamics in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF; 10,871 ha) in eastern Puerto Rico. Using aerial photographs (1936 and 1989), GIS, a model of topographic exposure to hurricane winds, and historical data, we sought to: (1) document historical changes in extent, cover and type of forest vegetation, (2) evaluate the distribution of land-use and hurricane impacts, (3) assess the contributions of these processes in controlling current vegetation patterns, and (4) relate these results to ongoing ecological, conservation and natural resource discussions.  \"With over 1000 m of relief in the LEF, the broad vegetation zones of Tabonuco (below 600 m a.s.l.), Colorado (600-900 m), Dwarf (above 900 m), and Palm forest are determined by environmental gradients. However, over the past 60-100 years forest extent, cover, and type have been transformed: in 1936, 40% of the LEF was unforested or secondary forest and less than 50% had continuous canopy (more than 80% cover); in 1989, less than 97% was continuous forest. Secondary forest and agricultural lands in 1936 were replaced largely by Tabonuco and Colorado forest, which increased from 8% and 28% (1936) to 26% and 45% (1989).  \"These broad-scale vegetation dynamics are best explained by a gradient of human land use, intense at low elevations and decreasing on steep, high terrain, which peaked historically around 1900 followed by a gradual decline in agriculture. GIS analysis and historical sources suggest that essentially all of the LEF was affected by human activity and that Tabonuco forest, which is the focus of LTER research, has been most substantially altered and is largely of secondary origin. Rapid reforestation following agricultural decline has obscured much of the past land use and confirms the resiliency of some tropical forests to intensive human disturbance. Impacts of earlier hurricanes (e.g., in 1928 and 1932), though not evident in the broad forest pattern in 1936, may be significant in explaining the distributions of Colorado and Palm forest. Damage from Hurricane Hugo in 1989 indicates that natural disturbance is increasingly important as land use declines and forest cover and height increase. However, this study and post-Hugo studies emphasize that land-use legacies are long-lasting and need to be considered in modern ecological studies and natural resource management. The subtle though persistent effects of historical human activities may have profound consequences for modern forest ecosystems in the tropics.\"" ;

    glview:description "Ungulates are attracted to forest openings created by natural disturbance and timber harvesting due to the abundance of high quality browse in these openings.  Despite the increased activity and browsing of ungulates in forest openings, the importance of browsing relative to abiotic factors such as light on forest regeneration is often unclear.  In southern New England, medium-intensity harvesting is the predominant forest disturbance attracting white-tailed deer and moose.  Oaks are the foundation hardwood taxon and predominant timber tree in the region and are in decline.  Hence, the effects of ungulate browsing on oak forests are of great interest to ecologists, conservationists and forest and wildlife managers.  We sampled tree regeneration and ungulate foraging activity across a range of canopy disturbances (35-90% basal area removed) in 34 stands of the Quabbin and Ware River Watershed Forests.  Browsing was very high across the plots with about 80% of red maple and oak stems browsed.  Taller stems were generally browsed more frequently than shorter stems.  Oak regeneration in the smaller size classes was generally lower in stands with higher percent cover of hay-scented fern.  The proportion of browsed red maples and oaks generally increased with increasing density of these taxa.  Despite intensive herbivory, oaks appear to be regenerating well with increased light in these partially harvested stands." ;

Growth, survivorship, and reproduction are in close balance, and matrix-models with four life stages (seeds, seedlings/juvenile plants, non-flowering adult plants, flowering adults) predicted population growth rates close to zero, with long doubling times. To further assess seed-to-seedling transitions, we measured and weighed Sarracenia seeds, and conducted a greenhouse experiment on density-dependent dynamics of newly germinated seedlings of S. purpurea." ;

    glview:description "Densities of ungulates are often associated with recent forest disturbances such as fire, logging and insect outbreaks, as increased resources stimulate tree regeneration, leading to abundant available browse.  Despite the often significant role that ungulates play in disturbed forests, surprisingly little is known about ungulate-disturbance interactions, and ungulate herbivory is often excluded from examinations of forest response to disturbance.  In the Northeastern United States, a large-scale insect outbreak, the hemlock wooly adelgid (HWA), has begun to have important effects on hemlock forests both directly and indirectly (i.e., by preemptive salvage logging).  No studies have examined the interactions of both moose and deer activity with these associated canopy disturbances.  Our objectives are twofold: to determine (1) the response of ungulates to varying disturbance types and intensities and (2) the influence of ungulate interactions with canopy disturbance on vegetation, other biota, and ecosystem processes.  We will examine the relative abundance of moose and deer in four treatments (2 replicates) at the Hemlock Removal Experiment using three indices of ungulate activity: pellet group density, evidence of past browsing on seedlings and saplings, and the occurrence of animals using game cameras. We will also monitor the response of vegetation to ungulate browsing by sampling woody and herbaceous vegetation in fenced exclosures and paired controls in disturbed and undisturbed plots." ;

In 1990, we initiated a large hurricane simulation experiment in a 0.8 ha manipulation (pulldown) and 0.6 ha control area of a maturing Quercus rubra-Acer rubrum forest in New England. We toppled 276 trees in the pulldown, using a winch and cable, in the northwesterly direction of natural treefall from major hurricanes. Eighty percent of canopy trees and two-thirds of all trees greater than 5 cm dbh suffered direct and indirect damage.  An enormous input of dead wood was one result of the manipulation. Many perceive an increased risk of wildfire after trees are blown down, but this depends on the amount, size, and persistence of the dead wood inputs." ;

    glview:description "This archive features long-term measurements of the eddy and storage fluxes of 16O12C16O, 16O13C16O, and 18O12C16O at the Harvard Forest EMS flux tower. Provided are the individual isotopologue fluxes, the total CO2 flux, and the d13C and d18O isofluxes. The eddy (iso)fluxes were measured by eddy covariance (EC), with a 30-minute integration period on a 40-minute duty cycle. The storage fluxes were measured as the increase in storage below 29 m during the EC integration period, based on vertical integrations over 7 air sampling heights on the tower (0.2, 1.0, 7.5, 12.7, 18.1, 24.1, 29.0 m), once every 40 minutes.  Corrected and uncorrected versions of the eddy (iso)fluxes are provided; the corrections account for high-frequency signal attenuation, and were made by comparing w-CO2 and w-T cospectra. The method is novel and complex and is described, along with all further details of the measurements, in an upcoming publication. The original, uncorrected cospectra are provided as well, for those wishing to employ an alternate correction method. These are not Fourier cospectra but rather multiresolution cospectra, as described in the following reference: Howell, J., Mahrt, L., 1997. Multiresolution flux decomposition. Boundary-Layer Meteorology 83, 117-137. The covariance is the simple sum (i.e. not the discretized integral) of all 15 points in the corresponding multiresolution cospectrum.  Finally, this archive provides measurements of the total molar mixing ratio of CO2 to dry air and of the isotope ratios d13C and d18O in CO2, at each of the 7 heights. For the lower six heights, these measurements are provided only as 40-second averages of the original 4 Hz data (which are too copious to archive here), made once every 40 minutes. For the 29 m inlet (the main inlet, used for EC), these measurements are provided as 2-minute averages of the 4 Hz data, made continuously during the 30-minute EC integration periods. The last 40-seconds of each EC integration period is included also as the 7th height in the vertical profile record." ;

    glview:description "EXPOS is a simple model of topographic exposure to wind that utilizes digital elevation data to predict which points on a landscape are exposed to or protected from a given wind direction. The model was developed to approximate the effects of topography on hurricane wind flow at a landscape scale (~ 10 km).  The model requires an accurate digital elevation map and a specified wind direction. Each point on the elevation map is then classified as protected or exposed, depending on whether or not it falls within the wind shadow cast by points upwind. The wind shadow is estimated by assuming that the wind bends downward no more than a fixed inflection angle from the horizontal as it passes over a height of land. The effects of topographic features beyond the margins of the input elevation map are of course not predicted by the model.  For a given landscape and wind direction, predicted protected areas decrease in size as the inflection angle increases. Application of the model in studies of two recent hurricanes suggests that the probability of wind damage in protected areas also decreases as the inflection angle increases. An inflection angle of about 5 to 10 degrees was found to give good results.  For more information on the EXPOS model, please see the published paper (Boose, E. R., D. R. Foster, and M. Fluet. 1994. Hurricane impacts to tropical and temperate forest landscapes. Ecological Monographs 64: 369-400).  Additional information is contained in the documentation that accompanies the program." ;

We employed stand-level pollen stratigraphies and tree-ring chronologies to examine the post-settlement dynamics of hemlock stands which have never been pastured or plowed, representing among the least disturbed parts of the central Massachusetts landscape. Although the sites are currently dominated by large Tsuga canadensis individuals and give the impression of great age and stability, our results indicate that they have dynamic developmental histories driven by exogenous disturbance factors, including logging, forest pathogens, catastrophic wind disturbance, and fire. Sites containing pre-settlement pollen assemblages indicate stand compositions at this time which were substantially different from each other and from modern assemblages. Pollen assemblages similar to those of modern stands were not established in any of our sites until the 20th century and the mechanisms by which these assemblages arose was considerably different in each stand, indicating great flexibility of forest response to a variety of disturbance types." ;

    glview:description "Permanent forest plots provide an empirical understanding of forest change over time, and are an invaluable part of forestry and ecological research. Walter Lyford began measurements of a 2.88 ha red oak-red maple forest on the Prospect Hill Tract of Harvard Forest in 1969. All trees over 2 inches (5 cm) were mapped on very large-scale (1 inch = 5 feet) hand-drawn maps, and included live and dead trees, stumps, windthrows and other features such as stone walls, boulders, soil moisture and a damage boundary from the 1938 hurricane. All living and dead trees have been re-located and measured (diameter at breast height, canopy class for live trees; condition, decay class, diameter, bole length and stem orientation for fallen dead trees) in 1969, 1975, 1987-1992, 2001, and 2011. In 2001, the original, hand-drawn maps were digitized using ArcView GIS.  From 1969 to 2011, red oak (Quercus rubra) increased its dominance of the stand’s total basal area from 52% to 60%; however, red maple (Acer rubrum) has become relatively less abundant, decreasing from 30% to 23%. While red oak and red maple continue to account for the majority of the basal area in the stand, the secondary species experienced a dramatic increase in relative abundance of individuals in the stand; yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), black birch (Betula lenta), American chestnut (Castanea dentata), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) have increased from comprising 25% of the individuals in the stand in 1969 to comprising 52% in 2011. The total biomass of living individuals is increasing linearly (R2=0.99, p=0.0002), which implies that the stand has not yet experienced an age-induced decrease in biomass accumulation." ;

A comprehensive understanding of current ecosystem dynamics and future responses to global change requires an integrated investigation of ecological processes at many levels of organization.

I addressed the nature of canopy-seedling feedbacks in mixed forests by relating seedling regeneration patterns in contrasting stand types to understory conditions (EXPERIMENT 1), and by directly manipulating resource availability to separate the individual effects of particular resources (EXPERIMENT 2). To investigate how nitrogen deposition will influence future forest composition, I examined the impact of increased nitrogen availability on regeneration of both coniferous and broad-leaved tree species under both closed canopy (EXPERIMENT 3) and simulated gap (EXPERIMENT 4) conditions. Future changes in forest composition might then influence whole-ecosystem productivity. I used two scaling approaches (leaf-level aggregation, EXPERIMENT 5; whole-tree sap flow, EXPERIMENT 6), I examined how the dominant coniferous and broad-leaved species in mixed temperate forests differed in their contributions to canopy-level photosynthesis." ;

Headwater streams are common features of many upland-forested watersheds in New England, yet are not explicitly factored into forest water, carbon, and nutrient budgets. Here we report on recent efforts to examine terrestrial and stream ecosystem linkages in carbon biogeochemistry in a hemlock-dominated watershed. A prototype stream biogeochemical system (SBS) was tested at the Harvard Forest LTER. The SBS allows a suite of stream water properties to be characterized in real-time over extended periods of time thus allowing questions to be asked at a wide range of time scales. The prototype SBS was field-tested in Bigelow Brook West on the Prospect Hill research tract at Harvard Forest. Bigelow Brook West was selected because the watershed’s hydrology, stream ecology, forest composition, land-use history, and carbon sequestration have been characterized, thus aiding the interpretation of SBS data and facilitating multi-disciplinary research. The prototype system monitors stream and air temperature, pCO2 , colored dissolved organic matter, total suspended sediments, PAR, water depth, pH, and dissolved O2. Independent estimates of organic and inorganic water chemistry were used to validate and interpret SBS data.  Here we report on preliminary findings from the pilot SBS at Harvard Forest to highlight the usefulness of headwater stream chemistry data to a wide-diversity of ecosystem scientists. 1) Low pH constrains dissolved inorganic carbon solute fluxes to downstream ecosystems. 2) CO2 concentrations were always supersaturated in Bigelow Brook, averaging about 6x atmospheric values in summer, thus the stream is an important source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Variation in CO2 appears to be linked to multiple mechanisms including changes in stream temperature, soil CO2, and in-stream processes. 3) Diurnal variation in stream dissolved oxygen concentrations is linked to both in situ stream processes and watershed processes, such as evapotranspiration. 4) Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentrations were tightly linked to discharge with concentrations increasing with discharge. The surprising additive effect of increasing DOC concentration with discharge cause DOC fluxes to increase non-linearly with water fluxes in Bigelow Brook. 5) Low inorganic N and P concentrations suggest that organic N and P may account for a disproportionate fraction of N and P fluxes to downstream ecosystems. Preliminary SBS data have already altered our conceptual model regarding terrestrial and aquatic linkages in the Bigelow Brook watershed and have illuminated a fundamental lack of understanding of the mechanisms regulating diurnal and storm-driven stream water chemistry in hemlock-dominated watersheds." ;

    glview:description """Headwater streams and wetlands with a combination of surface and subsurface flows are common features of many upland-forested watersheds. Unlike headwater stream reaches with continuous surface flow, the hydrology and ecology of subsurface stream reaches are poorly studied and not factored into existing wetland legislation. We assessed subsurface habitats and associated biota in a 435-m reach of a first-order, intermittent stream draining a riparian zone dominated by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in north central Massachusetts. Stream flow was found only in subsurface flowpaths beneath large boulders and surface root mats over approximately 70% of the total stream length at summer base flow. Temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon concentrations of subsurface water were similar to surface water. Macroinvertebrates were found in subsurface habitats
but at a lower abundance and richness per unit area compared to surface habitats. Collectors such as Chironomidae, Polycentropodidae, and Ephemerellidae were generally the most abundant families in both surface and subsurface habitats. Our findings indicate that in some glaciated watersheds, intermittent streams with no visual evidence of surface flow may contain subsurface flowpaths with water chemistry and biota comparable to coupled perennial surface flow reaches. The prevalence and importance of subsurface habitats in some headwater streams may warrant review or revision of existing state and local regulatory definitions of intermittent and headwater streams.""" ;

    glview:description "The DIRT Experiment (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) is a long-term study of controls on soil organic matter formation.  Our goal is to assess how rates and sources of plant litter inputs control the accumulation and dynamics of organic matter and nutrients in forest soils over decadal time scales.  Results from 11 years of field and laboratory studies demonstrate the relative importance of above- and belowground sources on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and show emerging long-term non-linear changes in soil carbon release and storage.  Treatments established in a mixed hardwood stand in 1990 are: doubling annual aboveground litter (DL), exclusion of aboveground litter (NL), exclusion of root inputs by trenching (NR), and exclusion of aboveground litter and root inputs (NI), on replicated 3m x 3m plots (n=3 for treatments, 6 for controls).  The O/A-less treatment, implemented in 1991, tracks the recovery of impoverished soil by replacing O and A horizon soil with B horizon material and allowing normal litter inputs thereafter.  Comparison of data among treatments (soil respiration, soil solution chemistry, soil physical and chemical properties, and microfaunal and microbial community structure) allows us to determine the contributions of live roots, above-ground litter, and belowground detritus to SOM and nutrient dynamics in this forest soil.  Similar experiments in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Oregon, and Hungarian forests provide information on these processes across climate and soil texture gradients.  First-year soil respiration results from the Harvard Forest DIRT plots showed that live root respiration, production of aboveground litter (leaf, twig, other fine litter) and fine root detritus each constitute about one-third of C inputs to soil.  Soil respiration is influenced more by root inputs than aboveground litter in this forest.  CO2 efflux from root-excluded soils (NR, NI) declined to 32% of controls over the first 11 years of treatments as soil C became more recalcitrant.  Excluding aboveground inputs (NI) had little additional negative effect when root inputs were excluded (NR).  Doubling or excluding aboveground litter proportionally increased or decreased respiration, respectively, from root-intact soils during the first four years.  However, after year 8, DL respiration dropped to near or below control levels, indicating decreasing decomposition rates.  O/A-less soil respiration rates in year 11 surpassed the root-excluded treatments.  C and N stocks respectively increased or decreased in response to doubling or excluding aboveground litter inputs to root-intact soil.  However, stocks declined only slightly in NI soils relative to NR.  Changes in soil respiration relative to total soil C mass indicate changing soil organic matter (SOM) quality across treatments and over time.  Root inputs remain the stronger influence on the proportion of respired labile C, which declined to 40% of control levels in the root-free soils.  Results suggest that aboveground inputs more strongly influence SOM mass, but root inputs have a stronger effect on SOM quality.  10 years of doubling litter inputs increased total soil C but by year 10 respired  labile C declined below controls, demonstrating a long-term negative effect on decomposition.  Total C in O/A-less soil did not increase markedly but the large labile proportion dropped by half as the young organic matter became more stabilized after 10 years of decomposition.  Soil respiration response to soil temperature was strongly and significantly influenced by treatment, and treatment effects increased with time.  Respiration by fine roots and associated rhizosphere organisms was more responsive to temperature than was bulk soil respiration.  DL Q10 fell steadily from year 4 to year 11 as decomposition rates declined, and was below NL Q10 by year 10.  NL Q10 changed little over time.  NI Q10 decreased more than NR despite the fact that its respiration rates are similar to or greater than NR.  Q10 for NI and NR decreased more over time than any other treatment.  O/A-less soil Q10 increased over time, and was higher than the root-excluded treatments’ Q10 in year 11.  Changes in soil solution organic chemistry required at least 5 years of litter manipulation.  By year 7, forest floor DOC concentrations were significantly higher in DL plots and significantly lower in O/A-less plots.  Response was mixed in the litter and/or root-excluded treatments.  Mineral soil solution chemistry was not affected by treatments.  The Oea horizon contributed 40% to forest floor soil solution DOC, leaf litter 44%, and root exudate and decay 16%.  Roots appeared to be a sink for DON.  Oea soil appears to contribute 107% and leaf litter 39% to forest floor soil solution DON.  Mean annual DOC flux was strongly related to forest floor C:N ratio but DON flux was not.  Mean annual DOC and DON fluxes were positively related to fungal biomass, suggesting that fungal biomass may be responsible for a large proportion of DOC and DON production.  Seasonal changes in DOC:DON ratios in root-intact treatments DL, NL, and controls suggest a decoupling of DOC and DON production.  Treatment patterns of DOC flux in year 7 correspond to cumulative DOC and CO2 release from incubated organic horizon soils collected in year 5, as did CO2 efflux measured in the field in year 8.  DOC losses from the incubated forest floors were 10 percent of CO2-C gas losses.  Total DIN mineralized in the incubated soils collected in year 5 was also influenced by treatments.  Lack of net N mineralization response to variations in aboveground litter suggests that microbial immobilization exerts a strong control over soil N dynamics.  Although net N mineralization rates were lower in soils from root-excluded plots, nitrification rates were much higher.  Incubated soils from the Pennsylvania site showed similar results.  These findings suggest that the absence of roots and mycorrhizal hyphae favor nitrifying bacteria.  After 5 years of treatments, microflora appeared to follow patterns of carbon availability and recalcitrance.  Data suggest that fungal:bacterial ratios decline with increasing recalcitrance of soil carbon.  Total fungal biomass tended to follow patterns of C and N content, being  highest in DL and lowest in NL and NI.  Fungal biomass was much greater than bacterial biomass in all treatments, yet aboveground litter inputs may be more important substrates for fungi than are roots.  Treatments did not affect the active biomass of fungi or bacteria in forest floors.  That litter manipulations strongly affected N mineralization and respiration in laboratory incubated soils suggests that the activities of microbial functional types were influenced by treatments.  However, microbial populations are poor predictors of process rates.  In summary, results from field data and intersite soil incubations suggest that aboveground inputs exert a stronger influence on SOM mass, but root inputs have a stronger effect on its quality.  The pool of turning over N is slow, having a different dynamic than the faster mineralizable C pool.  Metabolism of roots and rhizosphere organisms is more temperature-sensitive than bulk soil organisms. Exclusion of roots had a greater effect on microbial processes than either doubling or excluding aboveground inputs.  Declining decomposition rates accompanied by increasing soil C in the DL treatment suggests long-term non-linear changes in soil microbial activity which could lead to increased long-term soil C storage beyond expectations.  Changes in above- and belowground plant inputs and their influence on temperature-controlled processes will be significant in determining the effects of a warmer world on the net flux of carbon from soils to the atmosphere." ;

    glview:description "</field>ands form they create a temporal archive of community development, allowing the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics through the analysis of sediments and the development of detailed chronologies of successional change. Peatland formation occurs through two mechanisms: (i) terrestrialization, when a water body fills with sediments and peat; and (ii) paludification, the conversion of dry land to peatland. In temperate regions, where high summer temperatures may limit peat accumulation, general models of peatland development suggest that allogenic factors such as climate change control peatland development and that terrestrialization is the primary mechanism of formation.  This study evaluates this widely accepted model by comparing the developmental histories of three peatlands within the same climate region in New England in order to: (i) describe the development and timing of successional events among peatlands; (ii) document the roles of paludification and terrestrialization as developmental mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate the importance of climate change vs. autogenic factors in peatland development in this temperate region.  Basin morphometry, sediment stratigraphies, and chronologies of community change determined through radiocarbon dating indicate that peatland development at each site involved terrestrialization followed by paludification, with no apparent influence of broad-scale climate change on the timing of these processes. Paludification was consistently initiated coincident with the consolidation of a shrub mat across each lake-basin, and was controlled in extent and rate by the topography of the adjoining uplands. The timing of stratigraphic changes varied among sites, suggesting that autogenic factors associated with the accumulation of peat rather than regional climate change controlled development. These results provide the foundation for a model of temperate peatland development driven by autogenic factors and caution against the use of temperate peatland development as a proxy for climatic reconstruction." ;

    glview:description "1. Eastern redback salamander relative abundance  Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), an important late successional tree species, is currently threatened in this region by the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), a small aphid-like invasive insect from Japan.  While many species of birds and mammals have found to be associated with eastern hemlock dominated stands, there have been very few studies examining amphibian relative abundance in this forest type.  Eastern redback salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) are important components of the forest ecosystem as they are extremely abundant with a biomass found to be twice that of breeding birds and equal to small mammals in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest.  In addition, redbacks are positioned in the middle of the food web where they are important predators of soil invertebrates, potentially impacting soil respiration rates, and prey for larger vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, and small mammals.  Redbacks have been cited as excellent indicators of forest health due to these characteristics as well as their low annual variation in abundance compared to other forest fauna.  The objectives of this study was to 1) establish baseline data on eastern redback salamander relative abundance in eastern hemlock dominated stands and mixed deciduous stands in the Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA using artificial cover objects (ACOs) 2) test for differences in redback relative abundance based on forest type, 3) test for correlations between redback relative abundance and soil pH and forest floor temperature.    2. Juvenile eastern red-spotted newt minimum density  This study provides baseline estimates of juvenile eastern red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens) or \"red eft\" minimum density through visual surveys of transects in ten forest stands, five eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) dominated and five mixed deciduous, located in the Prospect Hill, Slab City, Simes, and Tom Swamp tracts of Harvard Forest.  The objectives of this study were to 1) acquire baseline minimum red eft density data at Harvard Forest, 2) test for potential differences in minimum density based on forest type, 3) test for correlations between minimum density and soil pH and forest floor temperature, 4) test for seasonal differences in minimum density estimates.    3. Time-constrained intensive searches  Intensive two minute searches of 1-m2 were conducted to measure eastern redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus) abundance and juvenile eastern red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus viridescens viridescens) or \"red eft\" abundance at ten stands, five eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) dominated and five mixed deciduous stands, in the Prospect Hill, Slab City, Simes, and Tom Swamp tracts of Harvard Forest in fall 2003 and spring 2004.  The objective of this study was to supplement other studies using artificial cover objects (ACOs) to measure eastern redback salamander relative abundance and transect walks to measure minimum density of red efts at Harvard Forest.    4. Artificial cover objects  Plethodontid salamanders are increasingly being cited as important indicators of forest health as they are major contributors to the overall faunal biomass in a forest.  In addition, they are positioned in the middle of the food web where they are important predators of soil invertebrates, potentially impacting soil respiration rates, as well as prey for higher vertebrates such as birds, small mammals, and reptiles.  Plethodon species also have lower annual coefficients of variation than other animals due to their small home ranges and terrestrial breeding habits.  A relatively new technique used in assessing plethodontid abundance is the installation and monitoring of artificial cover objects (ACOs).  Wood ACOs of different sizes have been effectively used as terrestrial salamander monitoring tools.  However, there is a concern that the quality of habitat under wooden cover objects may change over time as they weather thus altering their ability to track real changes in salamander abundance. More rot-resistant materials such as asphalt shingles may provide more consistent habitat over time.  This study compared the observation rates of   the most common plethodontid species in this region, the eastern redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus) under artificial cover objects (ACOs) of the same surface area - 1m x 0.25m - but different materials - 2cm thick rough-cut eastern hemlock boards and asphalt shingles." ;

    glview:description "</field> retrospective approach to reconstruct the past distribution of fire in New England and to investigate the important drivers of this pattern across the period of European arrival to North America.  Our study sites are in New England, and range from pitch pine and oak forests of coastal Massachusetts, pine and hardwood forests of central Massachusetts, and northern hardwood and spruce fir forests of northern Massachusetts and Vermont.  We collected sediment profiles from 18 lakes across the study area to assess fossil charcoal and pollen abundance over the past 1000 years and including the time period of European arrival and settlement.  Based on presettlement pollen composition, our study sites are divided into three vegetation types: 1) pitch pine and oak, 2) oak, pine, and hardwood, and 3) northern hardwoods.  The abundance of presettlement charcoal in these lakes is closely related to climate and the composition of surrounding vegetation.  Charcoal is most abundant in pitch pine forests and least common in northern hardwood and spruce forests.  Following the arrival of Europeans, charcoal abundance increases, at most sites substantially, and vegetation composition changed in a direction of either greater dominance by pitch pine or white pine, depending on whether the forests were located in the southern or northern part of New England.  The major factor influencing the distribution of fire across New England is climate, which has a direct effect on the physical conditions conducive to fire ignition and spread and an indirect effect on fire through its control on the distribution of vegetation at this spatial scale.  We find evidence that other factors exert some control over local fire regimes as well including landforms and their impact on vegetation composition, firebreaks, and prevailing winds.  Native Americans likely influenced the local occurrence of fire, but their impact on regional fire regimes in New England is not apparent from this or other studies.   However, additional paleoecological, archaeological and historical work needs to be done to better address this question.  In contrast, Europeans had a dramatic effect on fire throughout the New England landscape, increasing its occurrence almost everywhere." ;

    glview:description "The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of ecosystem nitrogen dynamics in response to elevated nitrogen inputs. With atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Northeastern United States currently at 10 to 20 times above historic background levels, it is possible that excessive nitrogen inputs could saturate the retention capacity of a forest ecosystem. Potential effects of nitrogen saturation include increased nitrate leaching and simultaneous base cation losses, soil acidification, altered fluxes of trace gases and forest decline. Two adjacent stands were chosen for the study: an even-aged red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) stand planted in 1926 and a 50-year-old mixed hardwood stand that had regenerated naturally after clearcutting in approximately 1945. The hardwood stand is dominated by black and red oak (Quercus velutina Lam.; Q. rubra L.) with significant amounts of black birch (Betula lenta L.), red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and american beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.). The dominant soil types are stony- to sandy-loams formed from glacial till, and are classified as Typic Dystrochrepts of the Canton or Montauk series. Four treated plots were established within each stand: control, low N, low N plus sulfur (N+S) and high N.

    glview:description "</field>ock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand; HWA), a small, aphid-like insect native to Japan, is currently migrating northward through eastern North America and threatens to eliminate eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere), one of the most abundant, long-lived shade tolerant species, across its range.  The major objectives of this study were: (1) To characterize the pre-HWA distribution, composition, and structure of hemlock stands; (2) to characterize the spatial patterns of damage generated by HWA across southern New England since the time of its arrival in 1985; and (3) to examine environmental and stand factors that are associated with declines in crown vigor and mortality of hemlock.  Aerial photographs and extensive field study were used to map and develop GIS overlays of 1000 hemlock stands in a 4900 km2 study region extending from Long Island Sound northward to the Massachusetts border and including the Connecticut River Valley in Connecticut, USA. Intensive sampling of a random selection of 114 hemlock stands across the study area was used to document patterns of hemlock infestation, vigor, and mortality in relation to stand and site characteristics.  Mantel tests were utilized to assess the relative importance of environmental and stand variables in controlling the intensity of HWA infestation and damage.  Most stands were located along ridge tops, steep hillsides, and narrow valleys.  Hemlock importance values ranged from 22 to 96% and stand densities varied from 300 to 1450 stems ha-1.  Adelgid presence and adelgid-induced hemlock mortality were found in 88% and 74% of the sampled forests, respectively.  Approximately 25% of stands were logged recently, ranging in intensity from partial hemlock cutting to large clearcuts.  A geographical trend in reduced HWA infestation intensity and tree mortality and enhanced crown vigor of overstory and understory hemlock occurs from south to north, coincident with the temporal colonization pattern of HWA.  Mantel analyses indicated that patterns of HWA infestation, hemlock mortality, and crown vigor were most strongly correlated with latitude.  Mortality was also weakly related to aspect and stand size.  Average mortality was highest on western aspects but exceeded 20% on most slopes.  Remaining trees averaged over 50% foliar loss, with no significant difference among aspects.  Results suggest that as HWA becomes abundant, stands on xeric aspects succumb rapidly, but that stand and landscape variables such as overstory composition and structure, slope, and elevation, exert little control over susceptibility or eventual mortality.  Ultimately, duration of infestation controls the intensity of hemlock decline and mortality.  Over 4,290 ha of hemlock forest have been eliminated by logging or HWA just within the southern part of our transect since the mid-1980s, and we predict continued HWA infestation will lead to unprecedented hemlock loss throughout the northeastern U.S., regardless of site conditions or location.  The same techniques were then applied to a large study area in central Massachusetts to continue these investigations at the northern extent of the HWA infestation range." ;

    glview:description "In 1998 we began examining the response of ecosystem processes to the stress and mortality caused by the introduced hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) in southern New England.  Healthy hemlock forests typically have slow decomposition and N cycling rates due to their low foliar N content and cool microclimate.  However, thinning canopies associated with HWA infestations are starting to reverse this trend, due to dramatic increases in light levels and soil temperature.  Within 8 study sites varying in HWA infestion level, we continue to investigate the magnitude and duration of N dynamics associated with HWA infestations by measuring nitrogen (N) mineralization rates using close-topped soil cores during the last five years. In addition, ion-exchange resin bags are used to estimate the spatial availability of N within sites and the extent to which NO3 is being lost.  Measurements of gravimetric moisture content and soil temperature were used with hemispherical photographs to assess microenvironmental changes. During the first five years of this study, thinning canopies from heavy HWA damage resulted in increased light, soil temperature, and mineral soil moisture, and decreased forest floor moisture content.  Heavily infested sites continue to have larger extractable NH4 and NO3 – N pools, and significantly higher net nitrification rates than healthy hemlock forests.  In addition, resin bags captured more ammonium and nitrate in infested versus uninfested stands.  Results indicate that introduced pests and selective tree decline can rapidly and dramatically alter ecosystem processes, even prior to the onset of extensive tree mortality.  In 2001, we began examining 2 additional stands that contain high overstory hemlock mortality and a dense black birch understory.  We will continue to sample these stands as they deteriorate to determine the extent to which changes in overstory composition, microenvironment, and soil conditions produce fundamental changes in the cycling of nitrogen.  Several decomposition studies have also been undertaken to examine how decomposition may be driving N-cycling changes in infested stands. Our study has focused on three key drivers of decomposition: (i) changes in foliar quality due to HWA herbivory, (ii) changes in forest floor microclimate that occur as the canopy thins, and (iii) the effect of species composition change.  All three have had an impact on decomposition.  Furthermore, our data suggest that these changes are coupled with N-cycling dynamics and may helped to elucidate the mechanisms driving increased N availability in these forests.  We sampled hemlock foliar N, C, and lignin along an extensive gradient of hemlock forests.  These stands range from uninfested to forests with complete hemlock mortality and currently dominated by black birch (Betula lenta).  Foliar % C and lignin were not affected by HWA infestation however, foliar N was higher in infested stands.  Higher initial foliar N was found to increase the rate of N immobilization in decomposing foliage.  Additionally, our data suggest that in many forests infested foliage may switch from a net sink to a net source of N more rapidly compared to uninfested foliage.  This may be an important contribution to increased N availability in infested forests.  Altered microclimate has had an important effect on foliar decomposition.  Surface litter decomposition was slowed in many infested forests due to poor conditions for microbial establishment on litter.  However, our work suggests this effect may be limited only to litter at the forest floor surface.  Cellulose paper buried at the forest floor mineral soil interface had significantly greater mass loss in infested stands.  We also observed that as surface litter became buried, its rate of mass loss increased in infested stands.  In 2001 we began a comparative study of hemlock, black birch, and mixed litter decomposition.  During 2002 we collected litter bags after six and twelve months of decomposition.  Results after six months show that black birch litter decomposed more rapidly than hemlock and mixed litter.  The higher rates of litter decomposition that occur after the switch from hemlock to black birch litter-fall are likely a major mechanism of forest floor mass loss after hemlock mortality and logging.  Taken as a whole, our studies illustrate the dynamic effects of hemlock woolly adelgid infestation on decomposition in eastern hemlock forests.  All stages of infestation studied had significant effects on decomposition by altering the chemical changes in litter, altering litter inputs (hemlock to black birch), and soil microclimate conditions." ;

    glview:description "</field>nsect pests may strongly disrupt forest ecosystems and trigger major shifts on nutrient cycling, structure and composition. Although the immediate impact of these pests are frequently examined as physical disturbances (i.e., defoliation, decline in leaf area, and tree mortality) that initiate changes in ecosystem function, the insects often generate fundamental biochemical and trophic changes in tree canopies that may be equally important in altering ecosystem dynamics.  Consequently, investigation of the linkages between canopy-level, ecosystem and environmental impacts may be critical for a thorough understanding of functional, structural, and compositional changes resulting from pest infestation.  We sought to establish a better understanding of these linkages for the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), which is devastating hemlock forests in an expanding region across eastern North American and has the potential to eliminate this long-lived and extremely shade-tolerant species across much of its range. We examined the impact of the adelgid on hemlock needle chemistry and epiphytic microorganisms, litter production, and shoot growth in stands differing in their levels of infestation and linked these to shifts in canopy nutrient cycling and stand and landscape dynamics.  HWA initiated major changes in canopy biomass and distribution. Whereas uninfested trees exhibit a decline in canopy biomass from the center to the periphery and a positive correlation between total needle litter and estimated biomass, infested trees support predominantly woody biomass, have significantly less total canopy biomass, produce less new foliage and exhibit no correlation between litter and canopy biomass. Foliar %N was strongly influenced by needle age and the level of infestation and was highest in young foliage supporting the highest densities of HWA.  Foliar %C was unaffected by HWA or foliar age. Epiphytic microorganisms on hemlock needles exhibited little variation in abundance within canopies, but bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi were significantly more abundant on medium and heavily infested than uninfested trees.  Throughfall chemistry, quantity, and spatial pattern were strongly altered by HWA.  Beneath uninfested trees throughfall exhibits a strong gradient, decreasing in volumes from the canopy periphery to the trunk. Beneath infested trees the amount of throughfall is greatly increased, spatially unpatterned and characterized by higher concentrations of nitrogen compounds, carbon and cations.  Across the southern New England landscape there is a strong south to north gradient of decreasing tree and sapling mortality and understory compositional change that correspond to the duration of infestation. Regionally, black birch, a nitrogen demanding species that is competitively enhanced by increasing nitrogen availability is profiting most from hemlock decline." ;

Eastern hemlock has unique structural characteristics that provide important habitat for numerous bird species in the northeastern U.S.  As a result, removal of hemlock by HWA has profound effects on avian communities.  Black-throated green warbler, blackburnian warbler, and Acadian flycatcher are very strongly associated with hemlock forests in southern New England and appear to be the species that are particularly sensitive to hemlock removal.  The hooded warbler, a species whose status is of regional concern, may actually benefit from the development of a dense seedling layer associated with high hemlock mortality." ;

    glview:description "This study examined landscape-level patterns of forest damage at the Harvard Forest caused by the 1938 New England Hurricane. For details on methods and results, please see the published paper (Foster, D. R. and E. R. Boose. 1992. Patterns of forest damage resulting from catastrophic wind in central New England, USA. Journal of Ecology 80: 79-98). The Abstract from the paper is reproduced below.  \"1. The effect of catastrophic winds on a forested landscape in central Massachusetts was examined to investigate the factors controlling the geographic pattern of damage. The study area, Tom Swamp Tract, Harvard Forest, comprises a valley and adjoining hillslopes supporting second growth hardwood and confer stands. Much of the study used records and maps that were analyzed cartographically with a geographic information system (GIS).  \"2. Areally, forest damage was distributed fairly evenly among different damage classes ranging from no damage to more than 75% of stems broken or uprooted. However, there was a negative exponential size distribution of contiguous areas of the same damage intensity, with a preponderance less than 2 ha; these areas ranged from less than 0.04 ha to more than 35 ha; hurricane damage exhibited a continuum ranging from minor damage of individual trees to extensive blow-down of broad areas of forest.  \"3. The spatial pattern of wind damage was controlled by vegetation height and composition and by site exposure, which is predominantly determined by slope orientation and angle. Approximately 3% of the stands in the study site occupied protected sites, 31% intermediate sites, and 66% exposed sites.  \"4. Forest type susceptibility followed the ranking (from highest to lowest): Pinus strobes, conifer plantations, Pinus strobus-hardwood = Tsuga canadensis-hardwood-Pinus strobes, hardwood-Pinus strobes, hardwood. Damage increased with increasing site exposure to wind and increased approximately linearly with stand height.  \"5. An empirical GIS model of landscape-level response to wind was constructed based on other stands in the same township (not including the Tom Swamp Tract). Hurricane damage in these stands was analysed as a function of site factors (exposure) and vegetational factors (height and composition). Model predictions for the study area agreed well with observed effects, suggesting that a relatively small number of variables can be used to explain the damage in this topographically simple area. Significant variation in the predicted damage under different vegetational scenarios suggests that the landscape-level response to catastrophic wind may be highly sensitive to historical changes in vegetation.\"" ;

    glview:description "Scientific data provenance is the information required to document the history of an item of data, including how it was created and how it was transformed. Data provenance has great potential to improve the transparency, reliability, and reproducibility of scientific results.  However it has been little used to date by domain scientists because most systems that collect provenance require scientists to learn specialized software tools and jargon. This project is developing tools that allow scientists to collect, visualize, and query provenance directly from the R statistical language.  The first tool (RDataTracker) is a library of R functions that can be downloaded and installed as an R package. RDataTracker allows the scientist to collect data provenance during an R console session or while executing an R script. The resulting provenance is stored on the scientist's computer as a DDG (data derivation graph) file.  The second tool (DDG Explorer) is a stand-alone Java program that can be downloaded and run to visualize, store, and query DDGs.  The third tool is an R script (DDGCheckpoint.R) may be used with RDataTRacker to create and restore checkpoints that store the R environment and user files. Documentation for all tools is included with the RDataTracker package or may be downloaded separately." ;

    glview:description "In summer, 2002, hundreds of thousands of salt-tolerant midges (Chironomus decorus group, Diptera, Chironomidae) emerged from Pilgrim Lake/East Harbor, Truro, MA. The lake is a former estuary but has been separated from the sea for over 150 years by restrictions associated with railroad and highway construction. Brackish conditions caused by leaky tide gates designed to drain excess freshwater from the lake, coupled with high nutrient levels exacerbated by a massive fish kill the previous year, created conditions that supported densities of midge larvae of more than 5,000/m2 and produced a severe public nuisance in the vicinity of the lake when the adult midges emerged. The emergence coincided with National Park Service efforts to increase tidal flow into the lake, as part of a long-term commitment to restoration of restricted coastal waters within the Cape Cod National Seashore. We are studying the effects of increased tidal flow on midge populations, and in particular evaluating how high salinities need to be to reduce the potential for further nuisance outbreaks of the midges." ;

    glview:description "Headwater streams, particularly those that flow only during part of the year, are understudied and underprotected in Massachusetts. Research being conducted elsewhere suggests that these \"Headwater Habitat Streams\" are important both for aquatic biodiversity and for ecological function of lower stream reaches. We are carrying out baseline research, involving research scientists and volunteers, on hydrology and habitat characteristics in headwater streams in northern Worcester County, MA.  We hypothesized that headwater streams exhibit a longitudinal gradient of hydrology, from (1) ephemeral channels that flow only in response to storms, through (2) intermittent sections that flow seasonally until the groundwater table falls below the channel and are dry the rest of the year, to (3) interstitial reaches that flow seasonally and retain pools connected by subsurface flow during the summer, to (4) the perennial stream. Results to date show a high degree of longitudinal heterogeneity in the study streams, with interspersion of perennially flowing reaches among low-gradient sections of vegetated wetland, high-gradient boulder piles, and braided channels. Perennial flow is found high up in some watersheds.  We expect our methods and results will have implications throughout the Commonwealth for local conservation commissions and other municipal officials responsible for land-use planning and regulation, state agencies responsible for land management and the protection of wildlife, regulators reviewing projects affecting streams, watershed managers, teachers and their students, private land trusts, conservation advocates, and citizen-naturalists." ;

    glview:description "In nutrient poor systems, plants employ many strategies in order to acquire and recycle scarce nutrients, including nitrogen. Low leaf N content is associated with low photosynthetic rates, but carnivorous plants have unusually low photosynthetic rates given their N content. The northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea readily uses any available nitrogen: NH4 and NO3 dissolved in precipitation; N mineralized from captured prey; the scant N in saturated peat; and N remobilized from storage. However, the dynamics of N cycling within S. purpurea are poorly understood.  We conducted two greenhouse experiments to examine N-cycling dynamics of S. purpurea at the whole-plant and individual-leaf levels. In the first experiment we assessed assimilation, translocation, storage, and remobilization of 15N supplied to pitchers and roots. In the second experiment, we examined how 15N assimilated by the first pitcher produced at the start of the growing season contributed to the production and maintenance of subsequent pitchers, roots, and rhizomes.  Patterns of N cycling were similar at the individual-leaf and whole-plant level. Pitchers assimilated 55 - 69% of available 15N and served both as the largest sink for newly assimilated N (more than 90% of the 15N assimilated during 2004) and the largest source of N remobilization the following spring. In contrast, N assimilated by roots was low and accounted for less than 2.5% of the overall S. purpurea N budget. S. purpurea uses both stored N and newly-acquired N throughout the growing season. The importance of stored N decreases throughout the growing season as newly assimilated N contributes more to later pitcher production." ;

    glview:description "The Hemlock Wooly Adelgid (HWA) invasion is expected to cause widespread mortality of eastern hemlock [Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere] throughout much of New England. Light levels in streams with hemlock riparian zones are anticipated to increase as hemlock are replaced by deciduous trees. We sought to: 1) quantify differences in light reaching streams with hemlock and deciduous riparian zones, 2) determine if increases in light result in higher periphyton biomass, and 3) explore the role of macroinvertebrate grazing on periphyton biomass as light increases in an attempt to help predict stream ecosystem responses to hemlock mortality. Light measurements were taken along 100-800m stream reaches with riparian zones of healthy hemlock and deciduous trees in MA and CT in order to document an integrated light profile for each stream. In addition, a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design with five replicates was executed on a deciduous reach of Egypt Brook in central MA, in which light (high light vs. low light) and grazing (high grazing vs. low grazing) were manipulated. Light measurements were significantly higher for streams with deciduous riparian zones than hemlock riparian zones. Controlled shading reduced chlorophyll a, while excluding grazing yielded inconclusive results. Periphyton biomass in Egypt Brook was found to be light limited, and grazing did not suppress periphyton biomass. As hemlocks die, in-stream light will be significantly augmented, and periphyton biomass will increase. A challenge for stream ecologists will be to incorporate multiple physical, chemical, and biological controls on biota in order to fully understand how regional hemlock mortality will alter stream periphyton biomass." ;

    glview:description """Dataset Abstract This dataset includes information about the LTER main site treatments, agronomic practices carried out on the treatments and approved site use requests.
Most long-term hypotheses associated with the KBS LTER site are being tested within the context of the main cropping systems study. This study was established on a 48 ha area on which a series of 7 different cropping systems were established in spring 1988, each replicated in one of 6 ha blocks. An eighth never-tilled successional treatment, is located 200 m off-site, replicated as four 0.06 ha plots. 
Cropping systems include the following treatments:
standard chemical input corn/soybean/wheat rotation conventionally tilled (corn/soybean prior to 1992) 
 standard chemical input corn/soybean/wheat rotation no-tilled (corn/soybean prior to 1992) 
 low chemical input corn/soybean/wheat rotation conventionally tilled (ridge till prior to 1994) 
 zero chemical input corn/soybean wheat rotation conventionally tilled (ridge till prior to 1994) 
 Populus clones on short-rotation (6-7 year) harvest cycle 
 continuous alfalfa, replanted every 6-7 years 
 early successional community on historically tilled soil 
 successional community on never-tilled soil. 
For specific crops in a given year see the Annual Crops Summary Table.
In 1993 a series of forest sites were added to the main cropping system study to provide long-term reference points and to allow hypotheses related to substrate diversity to be tested. These include:
DF – three deciduous forest stands, two old-growth and one 40-60 years post-cutting 
 CF – three conifer plantations, 40-60 years old 
 SF – three old-field (mid-successional) sites 40+ years post-abandonment. 
All share a soil series with the main cropping system treatments, and are within 5 km of all other sites.
For each system (and for a number of microplot treatments nested within the main treatment plots) the following baseline variates are being measured (described in greater detail in other data set descriptors):
plant characteristics, including species distributions and abundances, net aboveground productivity by functional group (crop vs. non dominant biomass, selected non dominant biomass), economic yields, tissue C and N contents, seed bank composition; 
 soil chemical and physical characteristics, including soil moisture, pH, inorganic N and P pools, total C, N, and P pools, bulk density; 
 soil biological characteristics, including microbial biomass C and N, N mineralization rates (buried bags), microbial populations, invertebrate populations; and 
 insect and pathogen dynamics, including distributions and abundances of major insect pests and predators and of Fusarium pathogens. original data source http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datasets/7""" ;

    glview:description """Dataset Abstract The Living Field Laboratory is a long-term rotation study established in 1993 under the direction of Emeritus Professor Dr. Richard Harwood to evaluate the benefits of cover crops (as green manure) and/or the addition of composted dairy manure in two integrated systems compared to a conventional and an organic system. The LFL accommodates every entry point of the crop rotation each year and has a factorial design that allows for the comparison of a number of interactions. These interactions include: differences in N management, rotation effects, and cover crops. From 1993 through 2005, the rotation consisted of corn (Zea mays L.)/corn/soybean (Glycine max)/wheat (Triticum aestivum) vs. continuous corn. During this period, crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) was seeded to 1st yr. corn, 2nd yr corn was in rye grass (Lolium multiflorum), soybean had no cover, and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) was frost-seeded into wheat.
In 2006, under the direction of Dr. Sieglinde Snapp and through consultation with a farmer advisory group, the rotation was shortened to a 3 yr rotation of corn/soybean/wheat vs. continuous corn. The remaining plot in each management system was converted to a 2 yr rotation of corn/soybean. Cereal rye (Secale cereale) is now planted after corn regardless of crop rotation. Cereal rye follows soybean in the 2-yr rotation. Red clover is frost-seeded into wheat.
The management systems are: Conventional, Integrated Fertilizer and Integrated Compost. Weed management is identical across systems, and nitrogen fertilizer management adjusted to take into account soil N availability and balance nitrogen inputs across treatments. The cover crop is present as a split plot (plus minus) within each system. The split-plot cover crop treatment was established in 1993 in Integrated Fertilizer and in Integrated Compost, while the split-plot cover crop treatment was established 14 years later in 2007 in the Conventional treatment, to allow a comparison of short and long-term cover crop presence.
In 2007, the organic management system was changed to a comparison of a perennial grain systems (perennial wheat-alfalfa intercrop) and a 4-yr rotation of corn/soybean/wheat/ alfalfa (Medicago sativa). This allows the comparison of a typical Michigan field crop organic system to a novel system that involves a new, perennial system. original data source http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datasets/45""" ;

      from the shore, with intermittent patches to 80 m. Organic matter averaged 257 gC/m2, and totaled 1388 kg organic 
      C on the soil around the pond.  Soil moisture content (0.56 to 12.41%) decreased with distance from shore, whereas 
      pH (7.8 to 10.8) increased with distance.  Electrical conductivity was lowest in the soils less than 10 m from the pond

      of the pond (1.21 +- 0.37 and 0.13 +- 0.05 mg/g soil, respectively).  Soil invertebrates were present in only 50% of

      non-parametric, discriminant function analysis based on soil moisture, soil organic carbon and electrical conductivity
      correctly predicted 87.0% of sites that had invertebrates and 70.8% of sites for which invertebrates were absent. 
      Tardigrades, rotifers and Plectus were found only in the wettest soils nearest the pond whereas Scottnema was

      Three species of nematode were recovered and Scottnema lindsayae was the most dominant. There were more juveniles

    glview:description "Climate warming in polar regions is associated with thawing of permafrost, resulting in significant changes in soil hydrology, biogeochemical cycling, and in the activity and composition of soil communities. While ongoing, directional climate warming can elicit such responses over decadal time scales, their manifestation typically occurs as discrete thawing pulses. Indeed, in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica abrupt changes in community structure and biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems following a summer warming event (Jan. 2002) exceeded the influences of a decadal cooling trend in both magnitude and rate of response. Thus, we anticipate that climate-mediated permafrost changes and their associated impacts on soil communities and biogeochemical cycles may occur over seasonal time scales. Our objective is to simulate different frequencies of permafrost thawing events in Antarctic permafrost soils. Since the top horizons of most Antarctic soils are dry permafrost (i.e., there is insufficient water content to generate ice-cement), with ice-cement or massive ice typically below 30 cm, permafrost thawing events are likely to result in subsurface movements of water that may manifest as groundwater seeps down gradient." ;

Every 30 seconds, the ADCP measured horizontal and vertical current velocities in six, 50-cm-thick cells between 0.5 and 3.5 m below the lake ice.  The observation interval became deeper over time as the ADCP platform melted into the lake ice and the lake ice thinned.

Data from 30 November to 8 December transition from pre-discharge to spring freshet conditions on 6 December.  Spring freshet was the most dynamic period observed with highest velocities recorded. Data from 8 to 13 December transitioned from the end of spring freshet on 10 December to summer diurnal discharge conditions.

Community structure was determined through a coarse analysis of the benthic community, initially completed in situ (2005), but using photoquadrats from 2006. There are quadrats analyzed at each of five areas within each site, and the areas are revisited (but not the quadrats) each year to support the repeated measures design. There are two tables available, providing different views of the same data: a long table having all values in one column and a wide table having a separate column for each observed object. Detailed methods are available in the protocols section." ;

Analyses were conducted in support of an ecological manuscript published in Oecologia  Adam, T. C., Brooks, A. J., Holbrook, S. J., Schmitt, R. J., Washburn, L., Bernardi, G. How will coral reef fish communities respond to climate-driven disturbances? Insight from landscape-scale perturbations.  Global climate change is rapidly altering disturbance regimes in many ecosystems including coral reefs, yet the long-term impacts of these changes on ecosystem structure and function are difficult to predict.  A major ecosystem service provided by coral reefs is the provisioning of physical habitat for other organisms, and consequently, many of the effects of climate change on coral reefs will be mediated by their impacts on habitat structure. Therefore, there is urgent need to understand the independent and combined effects of coral mortality and loss of physical habitat on reef-associated biota.  Here, we use a unique series of events affecting the coral reefs around the Pacific island of Moorea, French Polynesia to differentiate between the impacts of coral mortality and the degradation of physical habitat on the structure of reef fish communities.  We found that by removing large amounts of physical habitat, a tropical cyclone had larger impacts on reef fish communities than an outbreak of coral-eating sea stars that caused widespread coral mortality but left the physical structure intact.  In addition, the impacts of declining structural complexity on reef fish assemblages accelerated as structure became increasingly rare. Structure provided by dead coral colonies can take up to decades to erode following coral mortality, and consequently our results suggest that predictions based on short-term studies are likely to grossly underestimate the long-term impacts of coral decline on reef fish communities." ;

        on the natal reef?, (2) what is the response of P. damicornis larvae to conditions of

        combinations of CO 2 concentration (450 and 950 Î¼atm) and temperature (28 and 30C). Rates of
        larval oxygen consumption were higher at elevated temperatures. In contrast, high CO 2 levels
        elicited depressed metabolic rates, most dramatically for larvae released later in the
        spawning period. Rates of citrate synthase, a rate-limiting enzyme in aerobic metabolism,
        suggested a biochemical limit for increasing oxidative capacity in a warming, acidifying
        ocean. Biological responses were also compared between cohorts, larvae released from adult

    glview:description "The influence of density-dependent and number-dependent processes on individual demographic rates often results in ecological tradeoffs.  Because such processes have important implications for individual level fitness and population regulation, they long have been an important topic in ecological research.  I used Dascyllus trimaculatus , a site-attached planktivorous coral reef fish, to determine independently the effects of population density and group size on rates of individual growth and mortality.  Somatic growth of D. trimaculatus was positively related to the density of D. trimaculatus outplanted to host anenomes, Heteractis magnifica , with nearly twice as much growth observed in individuals living in the highest density treatment.  By contrast, survivorship of D. trimaculatus on H. magnifica exhibited a negative relationship with density.  There was no significant effect of group size on either the growth or mortality rates of D. trimaculatus .  These relationships suggest a tradeoff between density-dependent growth and survival in this species.  My analysis of behavioral data indicated that D. trimaculatus living under conditions of higher local population densities displayed decreased rates of intraspecific aggression because of positive feedback between local population density and the foraging distance from an individual’s host anemone.  In turn, lower rates of aggression and feeding higher in the water column resulted in increased somatic growth rates due to: (1) a reduced energy expenditure and (2) an increase in prey consumption.  These data are part of a Master's Thesis published by ProQuest:  Nielsen, Jessica Anne. Effects of density on behaviorally-mediated tradeoffs between growth and survivorship.

                Taiwan (lat. 21.95, long. 120.76), and Kimbe Bay, New Britain, Papua New Guinea
                (PNG; lat. -5.50, long. 150.12), and combined these observations with previously
                published data from Seychelles Islands (Polunin and Lubbock 1977), Great Barrier
                Reef, Australia (Cummins 1979), Red Sea, Israel (Karplus et al. 1981), Japan
                (Yanagisawa 1984), and the Gulf of Thailand, Thailand (Nakasone and Manthachitra
                1986). We also systematically collected and analyzed habitat data for shrimps and
                gobies in Moorea, Taiwan, and PNG. We found specialization was affected by
                variability in habitat use for both gobies and shrimps and by phylogenetic history
                for shrimps. Habitat use was phylogenetically conserved among shrimp, and thus
                effects of shrimp phylogeny on partner choice were mediated in part by habitat. By
                contrast, habitat use and pairing patterns in gobies were not related to
                phylogenetic history. This asymmetry appears to result from evolutionary constraints
                on partner use in shrimps and convergence among distantly-related gobies to utilize
                burrows provided by multiple shrimp species. Results indicate that the evolution of
                mutualism is affected by life history characteristics that transcend environments
                and that different factors constrain interactions in disparate ecosystems.  These data are associated with this publication: Thompson AR, Adam TC, Hultgren KM, Thacker CE (in press).

          bicarbonate ([HCO 3 - ]) in situ to test the hypothesis that ocean acidification (OA) does
          not affect respiration and calcification. Incubations lasted 28 h and exposed corals to
          ambient temperature and light with ecologically relevant water motion. Three treatments were applied: 
          (1) ambient conditions of pH 8.04 and 1751 μmol HCO 3 - kg -1 (Treatment 1),
          
          (2) pCO 2 -induced ocean acidification of pH 7.73 and 2011 μmol HCO 3 - kg -1 (Treatment 2),
          
          and (3) pCO 2 and HCO 3 - -enriched seawater of pH 7.69 and 2730 μmol HCO 3 - kg -1 (Treatment 3). 
          The third treatment providing elevated [HCO 3 - ] was used to test for stimulatory
          effects of dissolved inorganic carbon on calcification under low pH and low saturation of
          aragonite (Ωarag), but it does not reflect conditions expected to occur under CO 2 -driven
          OA. Calcification of juvenile massive Porites spp. was affected by treatments, with an 81%
          elevation in Treatment 3 versus Treatment 1, but no difference between Treatments 1 and 2;
          respiration and the metabolic expenditure concurrent with calcification remained
          unaffected. These findings indicate that juvenile massive Porites spp. are resistant to
          short exposures to OA in situ , and separately, that they can increase calcification at low
          pH and low Ωarag if [HCO 3 - ] is elevated. Juvenile Porites spp. may therefore be limited by
          dissolved inorganic carbon under ambient pCO 2 conditions.""" ;

This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. The abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) observed on a five by fifty meter transect which extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea time) during late July or early August each year. In 2006, divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small, stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 12m, those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m. In addition to the biotic data collected, divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed, wind speed and sea state, swell height in m, amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visability in m. This monitoring program is consistent with the protocols adopted by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and the Australian Institute of Marine Science for use with the Great Barrier Reef Long-term Monitoring Program." ;

                plots on the forereef following an outbreak of corallivorous crown-of-thorns
                seastars (Acanthaster planci) that caused mass coral mortality (see Adam et al.
                2011). Twenty plots were first established at Resilience 2 during July 2009. Half of
                these plots were randomly assigned to a structure removal treatment and all dead
                coral structure was removed by divers, while the other half remained unmanipulated.
                Following the establishment of these plots, in February 2010 this site was impacted
                strongly by tropical cyclone Oli with the result that most of the structure was
                removed from all plots. Consequently, during July 2010, a structure/no structure
                experiment was initiated on ten plots (5 removals and 5 controls) at a site not
                impacted by Cyclone Oli (Resilience 3). Finally, during July 2011, five
                unmanipulated plots were established at each of four additional sites (Resilience 1,
                4, 5, 6) so that community trajectories could be compared among sites. Counts of
                fishes, invertebrates, and corals are made regularily (at least annually). Coral and
                invertebrate counts are each separated into two data tables to reflect slightly
                different methodology. Initial coral counts included counts (and size estimates) of
                all stony corals, while later counts focused on corals from three genera,
                Pocillopora, Acropora, and Porites. Initial counts of invertebrates did not include
                information on size; all invertebrates were measured in later counts. In addition to
                in situ counts, all plots are photographed annually in 0.5 m by 0.5 m segments
                (e.g., 100 photos per plot).  *** This is an offline dataset (LTER Network Type II). Data may be made available

				variance by changing the scale at which the governing processes are operating or the

    glview:description """Recent literature suggests that for many lakes and rivers, the respiratory breakdown of
				organic matter (R) exceeds production of organic matter by photosynthesis (gross primary
				production; GPP) within the water body. This metabolic balance (GPP less than R;
				heterotrophy ) implies that allochthonous organic matter supports a portion of the aquatic
				ecosystems respiration. Evidence that many lakes are heterotrophic comes from diverse
				approaches, and debate remains over the circumstances in which heterotrophy exists. The
				methods used to estimate GPP and R and the limited extent of lake types studied, especially
				with respect to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, are
				two reasons for differing conclusions. In this study, O2 and CO2 sondes were deployed during
				July and August, 2000 to measure diel gas dynamics in the surface waters of 25 lakes in the
				Northern Highland Lake district of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The lakes
				were chosen to span wide and orthogonal ranges in DOC and TP concentrations. From these
				data, we calculated GPP, R and net ecosystem production (NEP=GPP-R). Over the broad range in
				TP and DOC among the lakes, diel CO2 and O2 changed on a near 1:1 molar ratio. Metabolism
				estimates from the two gases were comparable, except at high pH. Most lakes in our data set
				had -NEP, but GPP and R appeared to be controlled by different factors. TP correlated
				strongly with GPP, whereas DOC correlated with R. At low DOC concentrations, GPP and R were
				nearly equal, but at higher DOC, GPP and R uncoupled and lakes had -NEP. Strong correlations
				between lake metabolism and landscape related variables suggest that allochthonous carbon
				influences lake metabolism. Sampling Frequency: Chemical parameters and physical properties

    glview:description """Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important, but often neglected, component of lake
                ecosystems. It is ecologically valuable because it creates littoral habitat
                complexity but it is susceptible to manipulation by riparian process, in particular
                removal by property owners. The objective of this study is to determine the spatial
                scales at which human and environmental factors contribute to coarse woody debris
                input and output dynamics. Coarse woody debris, boat docks, and riparian trees (with
                the potential of becoming CWD) around the five lakes of the NTL-LTER site (Trout
                Lake, Allequash Lake (north basin), Sparkling Lake, Crystal Lake, and Big
                Muskellunge Lake) were measured in 1996 and 1997. CWD was defined as logs: greater than 2 m
                length, greater than 15 cm diameter, mostly submersed in lake, less than 25 m from shore, and
                less than 2 m water depth. Locations were determined as average of greater than 30 dGPS
                positions. Numbered aluminum tags were attached to each log to facilitate the
                long-term study of CWD. Return visits to Sparkling and Trout Lakes in 1997 found
                some tags had been removed by ice or vandals. Heavier tags were attached to these

However, WDNR data collected from 1997-1998 Â (unrelated to LTER sampling) is also included. In 1987 a joint project by the WDNR and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Center for Limnology (CFL) was initiated on Lake Mendota. The project involved biomanipulation of fish communities within the lake, which was acheived by stocking game fish species (northern pike and walleye). The goal was to induce a trophic cascade that would improve the water clarity of Lake Mendota. See Lathrop et al. Â 2002. Stocking piscivores to improve fishing and water clarity: a synthesis of the Lake Mendota biomanipulation project. Freshwater Biology 47, 2410-2424. In collecting these data, the objective was to gather population data and monitor populations to track the progress of the biomanipulation. The data is dominated by an assesssment of the game fishery in Lake Mendota, however Â other Yahara Lakes and non-game fish species are also represented. A combination of gear types was used to gather the population data including boom shocking, fyke netting, mini-fyke netting, seining, and gill netting. Not every sampling year includes length and weight data from all gear types. The WDNR also carried out randomized, access-point creel surveys to estimate fishing pressure, catch rates, harvest, and exploitation rates. Â Five data files each include length-weight data, and are organized by the type of gear or method which was used to collect the data: 1) fyke, mini-fyke, and seine netting 2) boom shocking 3) gill netting (1993 only) Â 4)walleye age as determined by scale and spine analysis (1987 only), and 5) creel survey.

The planters are constructed from PVC pipes of varying lengths. All of the PVC pipes are open at the bottom, and flush to the mudflat surface of the pond, resulting in the tops of the pipes being situated at various relative elevations within the tidal range. Plants growing in the shorter PVC pipes are flooded for a longer duration of each tidal cycle than plants growing in the taller PVC pipes. The growth response of S. alterniflora when exposed to different flood frequencies is monitored by monthly estimates of biomass (determined non-destructively from plant heights) and by destructive 'harvesting' of all above- and belowground plant material at the end of the growing season." ;

This study began in 2000 in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, USA, and the dataset is updated periodically throughout the year. The abundance and size of all taxa of resident kelp forest fish encountered along permanent transects are recorded at nine reef sites located along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel and at two sites on the north side of Santa Cruz Island. These sites reflect several oceanographic regimes in the channel and vary in distance from sources of terrestrial runoff. In these surveys, fish were counted in either a 40x2m benthic quadrat, or in the water parcel 0-2m off the bottom over the same area." ;

P. helianthoides can be an important predator in rocky reef systems and has been thought to contribute to community phase shifts on Santa Cruz Island. Divers conducting fish count in 2003 observed a rapid increase in P. helianthoides individuals and began counting this species during routine surveys." ;

 in the coastal areas extending from near Pt. Reyes, California, to Punta Abreojos, Baja California Sur, Mexico, including the Northern and Southern Channel Islands.  Data were derived from Landsat 5 TM images. Observations are made on a 16 day reqeat cycle 
but the temporal coverage is irregular because of cloud cover and instrument failure. 
Estimates of kelp canopy biomass are derived from the relationship between satellite surface reflectance and empirical measurements of kelp canopy 
biomass in long-term SBC LTER study plots obtained using SCUBA.  Data are organized into yearly files, and zipped to compress.
 In its entirety this dataset is large, more than 3 GB and 80 million lines.

Roots and soil are harvested annually in late fall after the growing season, and structures are reestablished in situ for consecutive harvests each year. Each structure allows roots to be harvested at two depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm) to estimate root production, or below ground net primary productivity.

    glview:description "The Monsoon Rainfall Manipulation Experiment (MRME) is to understand changes in ecosystem structure and function of a semiarid grassland caused by increased precipitation variability, which alters the pulses of soil moisture that drive primary productivity, community composition, and ecosystem functioning. The overarching hypothesis being tested is that changes in event size and variability will alter grassland productivity, ecosystem processes, and plant community dynamics. In particular, we predict that many small events will increase soil CO2 effluxes by stimulating microbial processes but not plant growth, whereas a small number of large events will increase aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and soil respiration by providing sufficient deep soil moisture to sustain plant growth for longer periods of time during the summer monsoon.To measure ANPP (i.e., the change in plant biomass,   represented by stems, flowers, fruit and foliage, over time), the   vegetation variables in this dataset, including species  composition and   the cover and height of individuals, are sampled twice  yearly (spring   and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots. The data from these plots is  used  to  build regressions correlating biomass and volume  via weights  of  select harvested species obtained in SEV157, \"Net Primary   Productivity  (NPP) Weight Data.\" This biomass data is included in   SEV206, \"Seasonal Biomass and Seasonal and Annual NPP for the Monsoon (MRME) Study.\"" ;

    glview:description "Previous morphological work on lizards suggests that the volume of growing eggs may result in a significant decrease in lung volume during gravidity. Iguanid lizard lungs are located within continuous thoracic and abdominal cavities and are highly distensible. Because of their distensible nature and lack of a diaphragm, both naturally occurring and introduced structures within the abdominal and thoracic cavities (i.e. organs, food, eggs) compress them and potentially reduce available lung volume for gas exchange. During reproduction, this decrease comes at a time of increased energetic demands, due to the cost of provisioning eggs and the physical burden of transporting the extra mass before laying. This means that females must increase the oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange with effectively smaller lung capacity than when they are not reproductive. Therefore, the way species compensate for this decrease affects performance, and ultimately the survival of individuals and their offspring." ;

Plots are clipped for ANPP in August each year and include moderately grazed sites in sections 24 and 25, ungrazed treatments at ESA and owl creek, coarse textured soils in owl creek, fine textured soils in section 25, as well as three catena topopositions in section 24.  Combined, these two data sets also provide an estimate of nitrogen yield.  b) Seasonal dynamics of life-form (dominant grass, forb, shrub species) nitrogen concentrations were obtained from random grab samples of aboveground plant tissue are taken monthly from May-Aug. and in Oct., Dec., Feb., and April from 1983 – 2007 at sites where ANPP has been  collected since 1983 (ESA, ridge, mid-slope and swale in section 24).  The objectives are to assess annual/seasonal weather and site productivity/management with quantity and quality of forage and/or litter production.  These data can be linked with secondary producer data sets such as annual cattle weight gains, grasshopper abundance, small mammal monitoring, etc., to assess how forage/plant tissue quantity and quality drive population dynamics." ;

    glview:description "Juncus roemerianus , the black needlerush, is a commonly found salt marsh plant. It exists especially in areas of little tidal inundation and low salinities. As such, it may play an important role in the accretion of marshes where sediment sources are not readily accessible. Biogenic accretion of marshes is a slow process representing the net result of production and decomposition. To study the process effectively requires long-term observations and experiments. We will initiate research at this site by selecting locations for study, collecting preliminary data on the locations, and designing long-term experiments. Plots for long-term observations will allow for analyses of changes in dominance of cover by plant species. We will choose plots to include the interface between J. roemerianus and other species and will follow changes at the interface." ;

The resulting data was processed with GPS Pathfinder Office using differential correction.  All data are in the UTM (zone 18) and the WGS-84 projection was used throughout.  During the repeated surveys of Hog, Curtis was developing methodologies and conventions for surveying sometimes confusing high-tide lines.  Each shapefile name contains the island and the date of the survey within 2003 in the form Rmmdd where mm is the month and dd is the day. For example Hog_R0717_05A.shp would be Hog Island, VA on July 17, 2003.  The raw GPS position files are also included. These proprietary (.SSF) files require the Trimble Pathfinder Office software to be interpreted.   Individual shapefiles for each survey day were later (2013) combined into a single shapefile with the island and date identified as attributes." ;

    glview:description "This dataset contains a bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) for Northampton and Accomack Counties, Virginia based on data collected March 25-30, 2010 and processed to yield bare-earth elevations.  It was created using LiDAR by Sanborne Geosystems under a contract with the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) with funding from The Nature Conservancy, USGS and the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-term Ecological Research project of the University of Virginia.  Original LiDAR point data (approximately 1 meter spacing) was used to create a digital elevation model (DEM) with a cell resolution of 10 ft. (3.048 m).   The DEM data layer is in the State Plane coordinate system (U.S. Feet) and uses the NAVD88 vertical datum with the 2009 Geoid for elevation in feet. As detailed in the included quality report, elevations are accurate to 0.65 feet or better.  Water areas have been hydroflattened and may also include salt marsh areas that were inundated at the time of the flights.  As a result, water areas were given a default minimum elevation below the minimum elevation measured by LiDAR over a given area and dependent on tidal cycle.  Areas at or below this minimum elevation within the water mask may include salt marsh and tidal flats as well as open water.  The elevation of the hydroflattening varies spatially.  Salt marsh areas within the water mask were later determined by VCRLTER staff based on the following factors: (1) present as marsh (code 18) in the NOAA CCAP 2006 land cover layer and not included as an open water feature in the 2010 USGS National Hydrography Dataset, (2) minimum contiguous area of 1800 square meters, approximately equal to two 30 meter resolution CCAP pixel cells, and (3) includes extensive areas of salt marsh within north-south flight line â€œstripesâ€, primarily the seaside lagoons and marshes south of Parramore Island and the town of Wachapreague plus Chesapeake Bay marshes immediately north of  Tangier Island (and excludes edge-only areas elsewhere).  Two polygon shapefiles have been added to this dataset: one shapefile shows the region-specific water masks and includes the elevation of the masks (in meters, not feet); the other shapefile shows areas of saltmarsh hidden within the water mask and includes a recommended replacement elevation (0.404 meters) based on the average above-water-mask LiDAR elevations of all CCAP-minus-NHD-water-determined marshes of all seaside marshes south of Chincoteague Inlet.  The two polygon shapefiles have been reprojected to the WGS84 UTM zone 18N coordinate system, and the NAVD88 vertical elevations converted from feet to meters." ;

These vector data were created by contractors for NOS who vectorized georeferenced raster shoreline manuscripts using Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI)(r), ArcInfo's(r) ArcScan(r) software to create individual ArcInfo coverages. The individual coverages were ultimately edgematched within a surveyed project area and appended together. The NOAA NESDIS Environmental Data Rescue Program (EDRP) funded this project. The NOAA National Ocean Service, Coastal Services Center, developed the procedures used in this project and was responsible for project oversight. The project intent was to rescue valuable historical data and make it accessible and useful to the coastal mapping community. This process involved the conversion of original analog products to digital mapping products. This file is a further conversion of that product from a raster to a vector product that may be useful for Electronic Charting and Display Information Systems (ECDIS) and geographic information systems (GIS).\"  Original NOAA-NOS-NGS data were organized by project, with each project containing a single shapefile containing the historical shoreline features from multiple T-sheets based on surveys from roughly the same time period.  There were 43 projects containing information from 208 T-sheets and TP-sheets that were found to cover the Eastern Shore of VA and southern MD and ranging in time from 1847 to 1978 (plus one set of shorelines from 2009 for the new Chincoteague bridge and the immediate surrounding area).  VCRLTER staff combined these 43 shapefiles into a single shapefile with an added \"PROJID\" attribute to identify the source project.  This shoreline dataset compliments and overlaps other VCRLTER shoreline datasets for the Virginia barrier islands that contain historical shorelines derived from a combination of sources, including: a subset of the included NOS t-sheets (digitized by VCRLTER researchers prior to availability in digital format from NOAA-NOS-NGS); NOAA coastal change maps; photointerpretation of aerial photos (from USGS, USACE, VITA-VGIN-VBMP, and others), and satellite imagery (from ETM+ Landsat 7 and IKONOS); and GPS surveys." ;

    glview:description """In order to study controls on metabolic processes in soils, we determined the dynamics of 13CO2 production from two position-specific 13C-labeled pyruvate isotopologues in the presence and absence of glucose, succinate, pine, and legume leaf litter, and under anaerobic conditions. We observed that the C from the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate was lost as CO2 much faster than its other C atoms (C2,3). Addition of glucose, pine and legume leaf litter reduced the ratio between 13CO2 production from 1-13C pyruvate and 2,3-13C pyruvate (C1/C2,3 ratio), whereas anaerobic conditions increased this ratio. We interpret a low C1/C2,3 ratio as an indication of increased Krebs cycle activity in response to carbon inputs, while a higher ratio implies a reduced Krebs cycle activity in response to anaerobic conditions. Succinate, a gluconeogenic substrate, reduced 13CO2 production from pyruvate to near zero, likely reflecting increased carbohydrate biosynthesis from
Krebs cycle intermediates. The difference in 13CO2 production rate from pyruvate isotopologues disappeared 4-5 days after pyruvate addition, indicating that C positions were scrambled by ongoing soil microbial transformations. This work demonstrates that metabolic tracers such as pyruvate can be used to determine qualitative aspects of C flux patterns through metabolic pathways of soil microbial communities.
