Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo  LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) 
to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. 
The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility 
and use of long-term data.  At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded 
research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, 
including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by 
the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, 
US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities.  Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal 
(http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data
compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application.
Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic
processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking
Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER 
and the LTER Network Office.  The following dataset from Hubbard Brook (HBR)

The 7.5-minute 		elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source 		data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient 		processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing 		data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data 		at quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a 		much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic 		derivatives. The specifications for the NED 1 arc second and 1/3 arc second data 		are: 		Geographic coordinate system		Horizontal datum of NAD83, except for AK which is NAD27 		Vertical datum of NAVD88, except for AK which is NAVD29 		Z units of meters

    glview:description "Data from a lake spatial metabolism study by Matthew C. Van de Bogert for his Phd project, \"Aquatic ecosystem carbon cycling: From individual lakes to the landscape.\" The goal of this study was to capture the spatial heterogeneity of within-lake processes in effort to make robust estimates of daily metabolism metrics such as gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NEP). In pursuing this goal, multiple sondes were placed at different locations and depths within two stratified Northern Temperate Lakes, Sparkling Lake (n=35 sondes) and Peter Lake (n=27 sondes), located in the Northern Highlands Lake District of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, respectively.Dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements were made every 10 minutes over a 10 day period for each lake in July and August of 2007. Dissolved oxygen measurements were corrected for drift. In addition, conductivity, temperature compensated specific conductivity, pH, and oxidation reduction potential were measured by a subset of sondes in each lake. Two data tables list the spatial information regarding sonde placement in each lake, and a single data table lists information about the sondes (manufacturer, model, serial number etc.).

    glview:description "The effects of riparian vegetation removal on a headwater stream in subarctic Alaska were examined using upstream-downstream and before and after comparisons. The study stream, Little Poker Creek, is located in permafrost-dominated taiga forest at the Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed. Three adjacent study sections were established: an upstream \"control,\" a section (\"cut\") destined for vegetation removal, and a downstream \"recovery\" section. Studies in 1982-84 examined pre-removal differences in the three study sections. Riparian vegetation was removed in the 160 m \"cut\" section in early spring of 1985, with differences among the three study sections examined in 1985 and 1986. Leaf litter input to the \"cut\" section averaged 0.58 g AFDM/m2 compared to 37.22 g in the uncut (control and recovery) sections. Temperatures in the \"cut\" section showed a slight increase compared to the upstream control section. There were significant differences in densities of macroinvertebrates and their functional groups among the three sections (generally higher densities in the control section), and differences among years for some functional groups. However, Analysis of Variance showed no significant section by year interactions, indicating that these differences were not attributable to riparian clearing." ;

Data for the overall study were collected between 1995 and 2003 by Eric Kasischke (University of Maryland), Kathy O?Neill (Duke University), and Jill Johnstone  (University of Alaska Fairbanks). Sites were located in burned black spruce stands within the perimeters of three recent fires (1987, 1994, and 1999), unburned black spruce stands adjacent to the burned stands, and within one black spruce stand that burned in 1956. The three fires were: (a) the 1987 Granite Creek fire located 15 km to the east of Delta Junction, Alaska USA, bordering the Alaska Highway on the North and Jarvis Creek on the south; the 1994 Hajdukovich  Creek fire located 45 km southeast of Delta Junction Alaska, USA, bordering the Alaska Highway to the North and the Gerstle River to the West, and the 1999 Donnelly Flats fire, located 8 km south of Delta Junction, bordering Jarvis Creek to the east and the Richardson Highway on the west. Data that were collected and are in databases associated with this project include: (1) latitude and longitude of all study sites; (2) organic layer depths in burned stands; (3) organic layer depths in unburned stands; (4) basal diameters of overstory trees in unburned stands and distance measures that can be used to estimate stand density; (5) mineral soil temperature and moisture data in burned stands; (6) mineral soil temperature and moisture data in unburned stands; and (7) bulk density and percent carbon data from different organic layers in unburned stands." ;

    glview:description "Starting in the spring of 1990 we have observed the timing of woody vegetation development during the growing season.  For the first twelve years (1990-2001) we observed bud break (50% leaf emergence) and leaf development (75% final size) on two to five permanently tagged individuals of 33 woody species at 3-7 day intervals from April through June.  All individuals are located within 1.5 km of the Harvard Forest headquarters at elevations between 335 and 365 m, in habitats ranging from closed forest, through forest-swamp margins, to dry, open fields.  For most species both overstory and understory individuals are represented.  Bud break is defined as when 50% of the buds on the individual have recognizable leaves emerging from them.  Leaf development (75%) is defined as when at least 75% of the leaves on the individual have reached 75% of their final (mature) size.  This point is used rather than \"fully developed\"antly.se the leaves are functional but still developing rapidly during this period, which permits better estimation of a date between observations.  Flowering and fruit development are also recorded if they occurred during the observation period.  Through 2001 these observations documented substantial (up to three weeks difference) inter-annual variation in the timing of leaf emergence (50%) and leaf development (75% final size), but good relative consistency among species and among individuals within species during these twelve years.  Therefore, starting in 2002 we maintained the same observation protocol, but reduced the number of species observed to nine, including striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), red maple (A. rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), beech (Fagus grandifolia), white ash (Fraxinus americana), witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), white oak (Q. alba) and red oak (Q. rubra). This subset of important, representative species allows us to continue to characterize leaf development each spring, and document inter-annual variability while reducing the resources required for the study significantly.  We have also recorded fall phenology since 1991, with the exception of 1992. Weekly observations of percent leaf coloration and percent leaf fall begin in September and continue through leaf fall.  Observations of leaf drop through 2001 exhibited less variation than those of leaf emergence, but similar relative consistency among species and among individuals within species.  In 2002 we reduced the number of species observed in the fall to fourteen, including red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), striped maple (A. pensylvanicum), shadbush (Amelanchier laevis), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), black birch (B. lenta), paper birch (B. papyrifera), beech (Fagus grandifolia), white ash (Fraxinus americana), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), black cherry (Prunus serotina), white oak (Quercus alba), (Q. rubra) and black oak (Q. velutina).  Although leaf fall continues to exhibit somewhat less variability than leaf emergence, very late leaf drop in 2002 and 2005 has expanded leaf drop variability significantly." ;

    glview:description """The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst
        et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more
        sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880
        to avoid the \"cold start problem\".  This version of
        the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in
        the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to
        earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global
        mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02
        degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction.
        The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal
        resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees).
        The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21
        levels.  The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed
        layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the
        high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995,
        Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model
        combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into
        an \"equivalent\" CO2 concentration. Observed
        concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a
        projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year
        compounding increase of equivalent CO2.  Another model
        experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from
        atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is
        included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to
        the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995)
        and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are
        the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the
        chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a
        present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4
        W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas
        forcing of about 2 W/m^2.  The magnitude of the 20th century
        warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed
        reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing
        from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect
        effect and the effect of soot.  The climate sensitivity of
        CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997). Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for
        environmental and social sustainability, but the character of
        this world differs substantially.  Education and welfare
        programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality
        and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about
        10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United
        Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at
        an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100
        the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion.
        International income differences decrease, although not as
        rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1).
        Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development
        of stronger community support networks.  Generally high
        educational levels promote both development and environmental
        protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few
        remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to
        address global environmental challenges are less successful than
        in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing
        agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual
        economic benefits.  The B2 storyline presents a particularly
        favorable climate for community initiative and social
        innovation, especially in view of high educational levels.
        Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and
        innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally,
        investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and
        mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and
        know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher
        than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic
        development and limited natural resources place particular
        emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation.
        Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of
        GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the
        average historical experience of the last two centuries.
        Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level
        in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a
        particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low
        level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on
        food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns
        towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in
        countries with high population densities.  Energy systems differ
        from region to region, depending on the availability of natural
        resources. The need to use energy and other resources more
        efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive
        technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at
        the regional level leads to success in the management of some
        transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due
        to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in
        agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in
        lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of
        elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy
        system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is
        a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil
        resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction
        in carbon intensity.""" ;

        strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to
        family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a
        series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing
        local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious
        participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to
        focus attention on contributing to the local community.
        Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in
        education and science and growth in economic productivity.
        Social and political structures diversify, with some regions
        moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income
        inequality, while others move towards \"lean\"
        government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although
        some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control
        and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees
        more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or
        B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology
        diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and
        hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the
        emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline
        only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this
        scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by
        2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the
        A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in
        2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in
        others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments,
        culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and
        mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies,
        while those poor in resources place very high priority on
        minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to
        improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs.
        The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by
        resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in
        terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but
        resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil
        technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability,
        nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and
        low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older
        fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements,
        agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for
        innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels
        of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through
        the local development of more sustainable high-yield
        agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and
        regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions.
        For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in
        Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production
        but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified
        exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world
        sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high
        GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four

    glview:description """The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst
        et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more
        sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880
        to avoid the \"cold start problem\".  This version of
        the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in
        the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to
        earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global
        mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02
        degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction.
        The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal
        resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees).
        The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21
        levels.  The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed
        layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the
        high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995,
        Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model
        combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into
        an \"equivalent\" CO2 concentration. Observed
        concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a
        projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year
        compounding increase of equivalent CO2.  Another model
        experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from
        atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is
        included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to
        the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995)
        and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are
        the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the
        chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a
        present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4
        W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas
        forcing of about 2 W/m^2.  The magnitude of the 20th century
        warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed
        reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing
        from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect
        effect and the effect of soot.  The climate sensitivity of
        CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997). For the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a
        strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to
        family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a
        series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing
        local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious
        participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to
        focus attention on contributing to the local community.
        Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in
        education and science and growth in economic productivity.
        Social and political structures diversify, with some regions
        moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income
        inequality, while others move towards \"lean\"
        government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although
        some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control
        and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees
        more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or
        B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology
        diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and
        hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the
        emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline
        only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this
        scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by
        2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the
        A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in
        2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in
        others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments,
        culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and
        mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies,
        while those poor in resources place very high priority on

    glview:description "This experiment was set up in the same macroplots at Field B E004 that were used in E060. Pairs of 9 m x 9 m plots were demarcated. One plot in each pair was randomly assigned to exclude birds (BEX) and the other to allow birds to forage for grasshoppers in the vegetation (BAL). A frame was built around BEX plots with wooden posts at each corner and heavy aluminum wire stretched between posts 1m above the ground. Bird netting (2.5 cm mesh) was then stretched over this framework and attached to the ground with numerous wire stakes. In 1989, these plots were set up 15 July, but were set up 15 May in 1990 to examine the effects of predation in the early summer. Between 15-25 August, netting was removed and grasshoppers were sampled within both BEX and BAL plots and stored in 70% ethanol for later identification to species or genus, counting and weighing. Grasshoppers were sampled by two people with butterfly nets. After the grasshoppers were sampled, the vegetation was sampled. Within each 9 m x 9 m plot, three 0.1 m x 3 m strips were clipped, sorted to species, dried and weighed. In 1990, the exclosures were set up 15 May, but all vegetation and grasshopper sampling was similar to that in 1989. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file trmte61." ;

    glview:description "Shrub encroachment is a global phenomenon. Both the causes and consequences of shrub encroachment vary regionally and globally. In the southwestern US a common native C3 shrub species, creosotebush, has invaded millions of hectares of arid and semi-arid C4-dominated grassland. At the Sevilleta LTER site, it appears that the grassland-shrubland ecotone is relatively stable, but infill by creosotebush continues to occur.  The consequences of shrub encroachment have been and continue to be carefully documented, but the ecological drivers of shrub encroachment in the southwestern US are not well known.One key factor that may promote shrub encroachment is grazing by domestic livestock. However, multiple environmental drivers have changed over the 150 years during which shrub expansion has occurred through the southwestern US. Temperatures are warmer, atmospheric CO2 has increased, drought and rainy cycles have occurred, and grazing pressure has decreased. From our prior research we know that prolonged drought greatly reduces the abundance of native grasses while having limited impact on the abundance of creosotebush in the grass-shrub ecotone. So once established, creosotebush populations are persistent and resistant to climate cycles. We also know that creosotebush seedlings tend to appear primarily when rainfall during the summer monsoon is well above average. However, high rainfall years also stimulate the growth of the dominant grasses creating a competitive environment that may not favor seedling establishment and survival. The purpose of the Mega-Monsoon Experiment (MegaME) is twofold. First, this experiment will determine if high rainfall years coupled with (simulated) grazing promote the establishment and growth of creosotebush seedlings in the grassland-shrubland ecotone at Sevilleta, thus promoting infill and expansion of creosotebush into native grassland. Second, MegaME will determine if a sequence of wet summer monsoons will promote the establishment and growth of native C4 grasses in areas where creosotebush is now dominant, thus demonstrating that high rainfall and dispersal limitation prevent grassland expansion into creosotebush shrubland. " ;

These plots were re-measured in 2004 and 2009 and will be re-measured again in 2014. On each plot, all trees (as defined as woody vegetation with a stem diameter at 4.5 ft (dbh) greater than one-inch) are recorded. For each tree, data are recorded on species, dbh, height, crown width, condition, crown competition, percent canopy missing and distance and direction to nearby residential buildings.  These data are analyzed using the i-Tree model (www.itreetools.org) to assess ecosystem services and values. However, more importantly, these plots along with a comparable set of plots established in Syracuse, NY in 1999 are the first and most spatially comprehensive set of long-term urban forest monitoring data within cities globally. These data are being used to understand how urban forest structure and associated ecosystem services are changing through time in the City of Baltimore." ;

Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo  LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) 
to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. 
The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility 
and use of long-term data.  At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded 
research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, 
including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by 
the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, 
US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities.  Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal 
(http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data
compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application.
Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic
processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking
Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER 
and the LTER Network Office.  The following dataset from Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE)

Four 10 m x 15 m or 15 m x 15 m plots were treated with sucrose, sawdust, fertilizer or were controls at 21 successional sites (3 reps of 4 floodplain and 3 upland stages) in both upland and floodplain locations. A complete census of all trees and shrubs (alder and willow) over 2.54 cm at breast height was carried out prior to treatment in 1989. Approximately 550 trees were fitted with diameter bands to estimate the tree growth response over the next 20 years. These bands will be read on an annual basis. The entire plot will be inventoried on a five-year cycle.  In 2009 treatments A and C were dropped after finishing the 20 year study period." ;

    glview:description """The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters 
(Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and 
Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo  LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) 
to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. 
The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility 
and use of long-term data.  At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded 
research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, 
including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by 
the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, 
US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities.  Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal 
(http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data
compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application.
Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic
processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking
Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER 
and the LTER Network Office.  The following dataset from Coweeta (CWT)
contains human population density measurements in numberPerKilometerSquared units
and were aggregated to a yearly timescale.""" ;

    glview:description """<para>We designed and conducted a survey of volunteers who work in city parks in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington to understand natural area volunteer commitment and motivation, as well as the effect that volunteering has on participants’ behavior and attitudes toward the environment. We contrasted volunteer motivation, attitudes, and behaviors between the two cities to better understand the role of governance in organizing volunteer efforts. Participants were sampled over the course of late winter and spring of 2012 during 25 different events. Volunteers’ motivations ranged from environmental reasons to those of personal health. Portland volunteers indicated that helping the environment was their primary motivation, more often than Vancouver volunteers. Portland area volunteers had significantly higher tendency to indicate that their primary gain from volunteering was helping the environment, while Vancouver area volunteers tended to indicate that they were helping their community. Frequency of participation was significantly different between Portland and Vancouver, with 35% in Portland volunteering more than 10 times per year; 21% of Vancouver participants engaged more than 10 times per year. Those engaging in the highest participation level were more likely to engage in public environmental behaviors, such as contacting local officials about environmental issues. Portland volunteers were more likely to feel connected to their volunteer site, and consider themselves environmentalists. 
A total of 131 Portland volunteers and 44 Vancouver volunteers were sampled during the 9-month study. They were asked 48 attitude and behavior questions, including other questions to solicit demographic information including gender, income, and age, and asked about travel time to the site.</para>""" ;

    glview:description """In the Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, BES) we use the watershed approach to evaluate integrated ecosystem function. The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Our long-term sampling network includes four longitudinal sampling sites along the Gwynns Falls as well as several small (40 - 100 ha) watersheds located within or near to the Gwynns Falls. The longitudinal sites provide data on water and nutrient fluxes in the different land use zones of the watershed (rural/suburban, rapidly suburbanizing, old suburban, urban core) and the small watersheds provide more focused data on specific land use areas (forest, agriculture, rural/suburban, urban). Each of the gaging sites is continuously monitored for discharge and is sampled weekly for chemistry. Additional chemical sampling is carried out in a supplemental set of sites to provide a greater range of land use. Weekly analyses includes nitrate, phosphate, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chloride and sulfate, total suspended solids, turbidity, fecal coliforms, temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH. Cations, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen and  metals are measured on selected samples. 

This dataset is for Rognel Heights.  This is a 7.8 ha urban watershed with no natural drainage network.  Samples (weekly grab and flow-weighted composite) are taken in a stormwater drainage pipe.

    glview:description "Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Study Plot Soil Metadata  Participants Peter Groffman, Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies  Richard V. Pouyat, U.S. Forest Service    Introduction   The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has established a network of long-term permanent biogeochemical study plots. These plots will provide long-term data on vegetation, soil and hydrologic processes in the key ecosystem types within the urban ecosystem. The current network of study plots includes eight forest plots, chosen to represent the range of forest conditions in the area, and four grass plots. These plots are complemented by a network of 200 less intensive study plots located across the Baltimore metropolitan area. See Baltimore's Vegetation Structure And Its Ability To Remove Air Pollutants And Sequester Carbon Dioxide, online: http://beslter.org/frame4-page_3b_02.html .  Plots are currently instrumented with lysimeters (drainage and tension) to sample soil solution chemistry, time domain reflectometry probes to measure soil moisture, dataloggers to measure and record soil temperature and trace gas flux chambers to measure the flux of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane from soil to the atmosphere. Measurements of in situ nitrogen mineralization, nitrification and denitrification were made at approximately monthly intervals from Fall 1998 - Fall 2000. Detailed vegetation characterization (all layers) was done in summer 1998.  Data from these plots has been published in Groffman et al. (2006, 2009), Groffman and Pouyat (2009) and Savva et al. (2010).    Plot Locations and Characterizations  In November of 1998 four rural, forested plots were established at Oregon Ridge Park in Baltimore County northeast of the Gwynns Falls Watershed. Oregon Ridge Park contains Pond Branch, the forested reference watershed for BES. Two of these four plots are located on the top of a slope; the other two are located midway up the slope.  In June of 2010 measurements at the mid-slope sites on Pond Branch were discontinued.  Monuments and equipment remain at the two plots.  These plots were replaced with two lowland riparian plots; Oregon upper riparian and Oregon lower riparian.  Each riparian sites has four 5 cm by 1-2.5 meter depth slotted wells laid perpendicular to the stream, four tension lysimeters at 10 cm depth, five time domain reflectometry probes, and four trace gas flux chambers in the two dominant microtopographic features of the riparian zones  -  high spots (hummocks) and low spots (hollows).  Four urban, forested plots were established in November 1998, two at Leakin Park and two adjacent to Hillsdale Park in west Baltimore City in the Gwynns Falls. One of the plots in Hillsdale Park was abandoned in 2004 due to continued vandalism.  In May 1999 two grass, lawn plots were established at McDonogh School in Baltimore County west of the city in the Gwynns Falls. One of these plots is an extremely low intensity management area (mowed once or twice a year) and one is in a low intensity management area (frequent mowing, no fertilizer or herbicide use). In 2009, the McDonogh plots were abandoned due to management changes at the school.  Two grass lawn plots were established on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in fall 2000. One of these plots is in a medium intensity management area (frequent mowing, moderate applications of fertilizer and herbicides) and one is in a high intensity management area (frequent mowing, high applications of fertilizer and herbicides).

The lawn plots had chambers identical to those used by Bowden et al. (1990) installed flush with the soil surface to allow mowing.  These (three per plot, at least 5 m apart and at least 5 m from the plot boundary) consisted of 28.7-cm diameter (ID) by 4.0-cm high polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders which were placed on permanently installed PVC base rings immediately prior to measurement.  From 1998 through September 2007, the forest plots had the chambers described by Goldman et al. (1995), constructed from 16.5 cm wide by 20 cm long pieces of PVC pipe fitted with a septum and an air-tight well cap. These chambers were placed 4 cm into the soil and had a total volume of 2 L.  Beginning in September 2007, the Bowden et al. (1990) chambers, which are used at many research sites across the world, were installed at the forest sites.  A brief period of side by side measurements suggested that the Bowden chambers produce lower gas fluxes than the Goldman chambers. The replacement dates for chambers at different sites are:  -Leakin 1 September 2007 -Leakin 2 Septemeber 2007 -Hillsdale 1 Sept 2007 -Oregon Ridge Upper 1 November 2007 -Oregon Ridge Upper 2 November 2007 -Oregon Ridge Middle 1 September 2007 -Oregon Ridge Middle 2 September 2007  At 0, 10, 20 and 30 min following placement of the chamber on the base or installation of the well cap, 9-mL gas samples were collected from gas sampling ports in the center of the chamber top by syringe. Samples were injected into 9 mL evacuated glass vials sealed with septa and aluminum rings. Samples were sent to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (CIES) for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Concentrations of CO2 and N2O are measured on a GC equipped with thermal conductivity and electron capture detectors aligned in sequence. Concentrations of CH4 are measured on a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector. Samples and standards are introduced into this GC via syringe and sample loop. Fluxes were calculated from the linear rate of change in gas concentration, the chamber internal volume and soil surface area.  Spike standards are processed along with each batch of flux samples.  These standards are generated by filling sample vials from a standard tank in the field laboratory in Baltimore and then processing these samples along with samples taken from flux chambers in the field.  Percent recoveries of the trip standards are used to correct flux values for leakage or gas absorption that may occur between sampling and analysis.  Exceptionally low recoveries for N2O (traced to a change in septa manufacture) led to loss of flux data for this gas for several dates from 2007 - 2009.

    glview:description """This research was intended to address the general question of whether asexual stem regeneration of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) reduces rates of establishment and growth of potential invading conifer species during the initial years following fire. Interactions between aspen and conifers were studied under natural conditions in a burned aspen stand with a high potential for aspen re-sprouting. The study contributes to our understanding of whether competitive interactions between tree seedlings are likely to help maintain deciduous stands across disturbance cycles by reducing the potential for successful conifer establishment.

Data from soil samples collected with a hand corer (one sample/plot) on 20 July 2001. Wet and dry measurements were made for moisture calculations and pH was measured using an electronic probe submersed in a distilled water/soil slurry.""" ;

The species studied include white and black spruce, aspen, birch, balsam poplar and aspen starting as green trees. In addition white and black spruce in recently burned sites are included. The study was designed to produce a time series of log decomposition measurements over the next 100 years.  The information to be measured on the logs includes weight and density changes over specified time periods, changes in nutrient concentrations, and hemicellulose, cellouse, and lignin concentrations, and changes in the quantity of nutrients and hemicellulose, cellouse and lignin.

                (11) and agricultural (7). The 40 non-riparian sites are a subset of the 200 CAP-

                April, July and October). During each session each point is visited by three birders
                who count all birds seen or heard for 15 minutes. Our goal is to study how different

    glview:description "</field>cted monthly observations of water microbial characteristics from each of the FCE LTER sites beginning in February 2001.  Bacteria counts using DAPI epifluorescence, heterotrophic bacteria production with tritiated Thymidine uptake, and algal energetics and chl a using the PAM fluorometer were determined from each of the water samples.  Bacteria counts in Shark River Slough in the freshwater end of the transect revealed highest bacteria numbers upon marsh rewetting after the dry down.  The highest overall count of bacteria was found at the most freshwater point adjacent to the perimeter of the water conservation area but only in March of 2001.  Peak numbers of bacteria in the saline end of Shark River transect occurred in December and July.  There is some evidence that these higher bacteria numbers in the SR transect are associated with higher salinities.   Highest bacteria counts along the Taylor slough transect were observed at the mouth of the Taylor River with peak counts in the wet season in October.  Bacteria densities also increased  from the eastern to western end of the transect in Florida Bay.  Heterotrophic bacterial production did not relate closely bacteria numbers and exhibited highest numbers in the dry season.  There was no discernible relationship between salinity and bacteria production as seen in bacteria numbers.  Monthly observations using PAM fluorometry revealed that brown algae was the greatest contribution to the algal chal a pool and this relationship was consistent across all FCE LTER sites.  Converse to the pattern of bacteria abundance along the Shark River transect, there was evidence that algal biomass decreases from freshwater to estuary.  In the Shark River, algal energetics increased from marsh to estuary as well as in the panhandle region of the Taylor River transect.  From these observations we conclude the behavior of the microbial loop and interactions generated between functional guilds is highly variable along individual transects and between the Shark River and Taylor River transect.  Wet dry season dynamics partially explain temporal variability in microbial dynamics along the individual transects yet responses were unique for each section of the transect as freshwater versus estuarine versus Bay.   Relationships between salinity and microbial parameters in this case, were not easily discerned but were more consistent within the two river transects than between river transects." ;

    glview:description "Water quality samples are being collected using ISCO autosamplers at all wetland sites (that is, all sites except TS/Ph-9, 10, and 11). The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these monthly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with an YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached. Rain event samples are collected, treated, and analyzed as all other water quality samples." ;

    glview:description "This study examines temporal and spatial dynamics in the fish community of the oligohaline to mesohaline reaches of ecotonal creeks along the southwest region of Everglades National Park. Collections of fish  in SW ENP during 2004 - 2014 across  Rookery Branch and Tarpon Bay. Sampling started in the wet season of 2004, and has been conducted three times per year at these approximate times: November (wet season); February (transition); and April (dry season). Electrofishing samples were processed in the field, and all species (except for non-natives) were returned live at the point of collection. In the Rookery Branch region, fish abundance varies markedly yearly and seasonally. Catches peak in the drier months, reflecting a pulse of movement by freshwater taxa into creeks as marshes upstream dry. The timing of this pulse is closely tied to the pattern of water recession in upstream marshes, and has important ramifications for wading bird prey availability." ;

They are the primary and secondary consumers of the plants mentioned above and they are the primary food resource for myriad piscine (e.g. game species of fish), reptilian (e.g. juvenile crocodiles) and avian (e.g. wading birds) predators.  The community dynamics of these fishes are dictated by hydrologic and hydrographic parameters so they also respond predictably to water management practices.  Because they are a bottle-neck in the food web, their abundance and availability dictate the success of higher trophic levels.  Fish are sampled in June, September and monthly from November through April at five locations.  A 9m2 drop trap designed specifically for this habitat are used to quantify fish use.  Nine traps are used at each site." ;

This work included the release of the tracer (SF6), which was sampled in a lagrangian approach as the tracer “patch” moved from the fresh water portion of the system to the mangrove ecotone along the Shark and Harney Rivers.  The goal of this study was to measure carbon export through the system.  Annie Palya used our new CRDS system to measure the isotopic composition (d13C) of the DOM & DIC (analyzed at RSMAS) during this study, as carbon isotopes may help to resolve different sources of carbon.  This analytical approach is relatively new, and will be important for understanding the C-dynamics within the FCE." ;

    glview:description "A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2012 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 3 sampling sites on the creekbank of the Altamaha River. The sites were chosen to capture the transition from Spartina alterniflora to Spartina cynosuroides (site SCSA) and the transition from Spartina cynosuroides to Zizaniopsis miliacea (sites ZSC1 and ZSC2). The quadrats were established as permanent plots in October 2012 by placing PVC stakes along the creekbank at each site.  Plots were evenly spaced, but were not randomly located because the goal was to start with mixtures of vegetation in most of the plots, and vegetation was distributed in patches along the creekbanks. Therefore, these plots provide useful measures of vegetation change, but are not a random sample of the vegetation at the site. Plots will be replaced as needed in future years to replace any lost to disturbance. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set. This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts." ;

This is true of inland pine barrens in the northeastern United States. In the Northeast, such barrens support uncommon ant species and high species density for the region. Ants in inland barrens of New York State barely have been studied. To increase knowledge of these assemblages, I systematically collected ants from three NY inland barrens and investigated how hiking trails--a common man-made disturbance--may be impacting ant assemblages in these early-successional, disturbance-dependent ecosystems. My data strongly indicate uncommonly high densities of ant species in NY pine barrens, including the most northern known occurrences of two species, and show that hiking trails alter ant assemblage composition and species density." ;

    glview:description "In the past 25 years, moose have spread south from Vermont and New Hampshire and recolonized their pre-historical range limit in southern New England from which they had been extirpated almost 200 years earlier. Intensive moose browsing in the boreal forest has caused declines in forest density and shifts in species composition in some areas, generating considerable interest and concern among foresters, wildlife managers, and ecologists as to how moose along with white-tailed deer will impact forest regeneration, composition, and diversity in this region. Harvard Forest in collaboration with researchers at the USGS Massachusetts Cooperative Research Unit has initiated a long-term study of the role of moose and deer in SNE forests using experimental exclosures.  The design is a randomized block with 3 factors -- full exclosure, partial exclosure, and control plot. Full exclosures exclude both moose and deer but allow access to small mammals such as mice, squirrels, and rabbits. Partial exclosures have a 60cm opening around the bottom perimeter of the fence, which excludes moose but allows access to deer and other small and medium-sized animals. The design enables us to quantify forest composition and structure in areas (1) exposed to moose and deer browsing, (2) protected from moose and deer browsing, and (3) exposed to deer browsing but protected from moose browsing." ;

    glview:description "Large herbivores are important forest disturbances capable of altering community composition, biodiversity, tree density, successional pathways, and nutrient cycling.  The extent to which browsers exert important impacts on forests, however, depends on the intensity and duration of browsing, the palatability and tolerance of the vegetation, available resources to plants, and the scale at which these factors are being investigated.  Few studies have examined ungulate impacts at the landscape scale.  Since the late-1980s moose have recolonized their pre-historical range in southern New England, joined white-tailed deer to create a potentially important new driver of forest dynamics in the region.  Few, if any, studies have looked at combined deer and moose impacts on temperate forests in eastern North America.  In the summer of 2010, we initiated a landscape-scale observational study on ungulate habitat use and browsing on foundation tree species (Quercus spp. and Tsuga canadensis) in unlogged forests.  Seventy-two forest plots were sampled across several ecoregions in central and western Massachusetts, southern Vermont and New Hampshire and northern Connecticut.  Tree seedlings, overstory characteristics, browsing, pellet piles, and shrub densities were sampled; and site attributes such as mean annual temperature and forest fragmentation were examined." ;

    glview:description "Total soil respiration (Rt) is a combination of autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh).  Several methods have been developed to tease out the components of Rt, such as isotopic analyses, and removing Ra input through tree girdling and root exclusion experiments.  Trenching involves severing the rooting system surrounding a plot to remove the Ra component within the plot. This method has some potential limitations.  Reduced water uptake in trenched plots could change soil water content, which is one of the environmental controllers of Rt in many ecosystems.  Eliminating root inputs could reduce heterotrophic decomposition of SOM via lack of priming. On the other hand, the severed dead roots may temporarily increase available carbon substrate for Rh. We utilized the trenching method to partition the autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration in an oak dominated forest with the footprint of the LPH tower." ;

    glview:description "Starting in the spring of 1990 we have observed the timing of woody vegetation development during the growing season.  For the first twelve years (1990-2001) we observed bud break (50% leaf emergence) and leaf development (75% final size) on two to five permanently tagged individuals of 33 woody species at 3-7 day intervals from April through June.  All individuals are located within 1.5 km of the Harvard Forest headquarters at elevations between 335 and 365 m, in habitats ranging from closed forest, through forest-swamp margins, to dry, open fields.  For most species both overstory and understory individuals are represented.  Bud break is defined as when 50% of the buds on the individual have recognizable leaves emerging from them.  Leaf development (75%) is defined as when at least 75% of the leaves on the individual have reached 75% of their final (mature) size.  This point is used rather than \"fully developed\" because the leaves are functional but still developing rapidly during this period, which permits better estimation of a date between observations.  Flowering and fruit development are also recorded if they occurred during the observation period.  Through 2001 these observations documented substantial (up to three weeks difference) inter-annual variation in the timing of leaf emergence (50%) and leaf development (75% final size), but good relative consistency among species and among individuals within species during these twelve years.  Therefore, starting in 2002 we maintained the same observation protocol, but reduced the number of species observed to nine, including striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum), red maple (A. rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), beech (Fagus grandifolia), white ash (Fraxinus americana), witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), white oak (Q. alba) and red oak (Q. rubra). This subset of important, representative species allows us to continue to characterize leaf development each spring, and document inter-annual variability while reducing the resources required for the study significantly.  We have also recorded fall phenology since 1991, with the exception of 1992. Weekly observations of percent leaf coloration and percent leaf fall begin in September and continue through leaf fall.  Observations of leaf drop through 2001 exhibited less variation than those of leaf emergence, but similar relative consistency among species and among individuals within species.  In 2002 we reduced the number of species observed in the fall to fourteen, including red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), striped maple (A. pensylvanicum), shadbush (Amelanchier laevis), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), black birch (B. lenta), paper birch (B. papyrifera), beech (Fagus grandifolia), white ash (Fraxinus americana), black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), black cherry (Prunus serotina), white oak (Quercus alba), (Q. rubra) and black oak (Q. velutina).  Although leaf fall continues to exhibit somewhat less variability than leaf emergence, very late leaf drop in 2002 and 2005 has expanded leaf drop variability significantly." ;

    glview:description "The tower-based CO2 measurements and key meteorological drivers are intended to examine how regional and ecosystem level processes in a mid-latitude forest contribute to global carbon cycling. Specifically, we endeavor to understand quantitatively how and why forested ecosystems take up or release carbon, on time scales from hours to decades, and to elucidate responses to climate changes and management interventions.  The tower was installed 1989 and the resulting eddy-flux measurements constitute the longest running record of the net-ecosystem carbon exchange in a North American Forest. The resulting long-term record of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) has shown the effects of climate anomalies on carbon fluxes for seasonal and annual time scales. For example, reduced soil frost allows greater respiration in the winter leading to lower C sequestration. Cumulative gross photosynthesis depends on when the canopy emerges in the spring. Warmer springtime temperatures lead to greater uptake of C. As the NEE record is extended and augmented by supporting ecological measurements, we can further identify longer-term effects of climate perturbations on carbon fluxes and further define the relationship between stand history and carbon sequestration.  Climatic anomalies in one season or year may have a longer-term effect on the sequestration of carbon in subsequent seasons or years.  The flux and ecological measurements are coordinated with studies at other sites through the AmeriFlux network. By examining the relationships between carbon fluxes and the driving physical and biological variables across a range of sites we are enhancing understanding of the processes that control NEE." ;

    glview:description "</field> warming experiment was installed on the Prospect Hill tract in 1991 to allow us to investigate the effects of a 5 deg C temperature increase on soil processes fundamental to the global cycling of carbon and nitrogen. The experiment is located in an even-aged mixed hardwood forest. Six replicates of three treatments, Heated (resistance heating cables buried at 10cm and maintained at a 5 deg C differential from the control plots), Disturbance Control (cables installed but not powered) and Control treatments make up the randomized block design. The temperature differential is maintained with monitoring at five minute increments by an automated thermister network in the plots, wired to a multiplexer and a datalogger in the control shed. In the plots, measurements of trace gasses (CO2, N2O and CH4), nitrogen mineralization, soil moisture and soil water chemistry have allowed us to quantify changes in the soil system.  Ten years of elevated soil temperatures at the Harvard Forest soil warming experiment suggest that there are limits to a positive feedback to the global warming cycle. After many early years of increased CO2 fluxes from the warmed plots, years nine and ten have revealed no significant differences in releases of CO2 between the heated and control plots. Nitrogen mineralization has shown a large response to warming as well, with twice the rate of N mineralized in years 1-4, followed by a gradual decrease in rates to about the 40% level in 1998.  Resumption of mineralization measurements in 2001 reveal a continued decrease in mineralization rates.  Field results from the soil warming experiment indicate that only a small fraction of the soil carbon in this mid-latitude forest ecosystem will be lost to the atmosphere in response to warming. We find that a 5 deg C warming of the soil for a decade results in a loss of about 11% of the carbon stored in the top 60 cm of soil, with most of this loss occurring in the first four to five years. By the end of the decade, warming no longer stimulates soil carbon loss. In addition, we find that warming accelerates the soil nitrogen cycle, particularly in the early years of warming. This acceleration has the potential to stimulate plant carbon storage.  Calculations based on nitrogen uptake in vegetation at the Chronic N Experiment (Magill, Aber et al. 2000) allow us to estimate how much additional carbon might be stored in plants as a result increased N availability at soil warming. Our calculations show that the potential increase in carbon stored is large enough to more than compensate for the soil carbon loss, so that warming may actually stimulate carbon storage at the ecosystem level in this mid-latitude forest.  We are currently expanding our research from the original soil warming experiment to investigate this important feedback at the Harvard Forest. The existing 6x6m plots on the Prospect Hill tract are not large enough to allow for the study of treatment effects on trees, so we are installing a larger warming experiment. The new experiment will have two 30x30m plots, a heated and a control plot, in the Slab City Tract of the Harvard Forest. Many aspects of this experiment will be the same as the original. Using resistance heating cables and thermisters, we will maintain a 5 deg C differential between the heated and control plots, year-round. In addition to the trace gas, nitrogen mineralization and soil water parameters measured to date, we will also be measuring woody increment and other vegetation metrics to allow us to investigate the plant response to perturbations in the carbon and nitrogen cycles." ;

In pursuing this goal, multiple sondes were placed at different locations and depths within two stratified Northern Temperate Lakes, Sparkling Lake (n=35 sondes) and Peter Lake (n=27 sondes), located in the Northern Highlands Lake District of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, respectively.Dissolved oxygen and temperature measurements were made every 10 minutes over a 10 day period for each lake in July and August of 2007. Dissolved oxygen measurements were corrected for drift. In addition, conductivity, temperature compensated specific conductivity, pH, and oxidation reduction potential were measured by a subset of sondes in each lake. Two data tables list the spatial information regarding sonde placement in each lake, and a single data table lists information about the sondes (manufacturer, model, serial number etc.).

    glview:description "The effect of Crab Burrows on Soil Nutrients and Spartina alterniflora   by Winli Lin  This study investigated the effects of fiddler crab ( Uca pugnax ) burrows on soil nutrients and the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora .  Tall-form Spartina alterniflora (1-2m tall) typically dominates the marsh area that is flooded daily by tides. The short-form S. alterniflora (<0.5m tall) generally occupies the higher tidal heights (Bertness 1985). These short-form S. alterniflora are charterized by reduced soil drainage (Mendelssohn and Senecs 1980; Howes et al. 1981; Mendelssohn et al. 1981) and increased soil sulfide levels (King et al. 1982).  From comparing control areas devoid of burrrows to those with burrows added, an increase in above-ground Spartina alterniflora production has been observed along with an increase of soil drainage rates and redox potential levels (Bertness 1985). Others have looked at how nutrient availability (Mendelssohn 1979) and sulfide accumulation (King et al. 1982; Howarth and Giblin 1983) may be the primary limiting factors controlling the production and success of S. alterniflora . While soil water movement has been shown to influence the soil parameters, (i.e., sulfide concentration and redox potential) that directly affect cordgrass production (King et al. 1982; Koch et al. 1990), little has been studied on how biotic modifications, such as crab burrows, mediate these physical factors.  The Uca pugnax , are burrowing deposit-feeders that excavate and maintain semi-permanent burrows in the marsh surface. They have been found to not only oxygenate marsh soils (Howes et al 1981) and modify sediment meiofaunal abundance, they could also provide a suitable environment for continued burrowing and, as a byproduct, increase the marsh grass production and maintain the tall-form S. alterniflora . Uca pugnax , the mud fiddler crab, is the dominant form of crab seen in Brownsville, VA. Their burrows are primarily restricted to areas of tall-form S. alterniflora , due to the intermediate substrate hardness and root mat density (Bertness and Miller 1985). Therefore, the effects of burrows will be more evident when studied in areas of shorter S. alterniflora with minimal burrow density.  The objective of this study was to compare areas of minimal burrow density to those with burrows added, in shorter S. alterniflora on a mainland marsh. I hypothesized that the areas with added burrows would show: (1) a decrease in soil sulfide concentration, (2) changes in other nutrient concentrations and (3) an increase in above- and below-ground growth of Spartina alterniflora .  The marsh studied was in Brownsville, VA. The site was located near the bank of No Name Creek. The focus of the experiment is on the effect of crab burrows because there were some Sesarma reticulatum burrows found. But more than 90% were created by Uca pugnax .  In the first week of June 1992, 10 split-blocks were put in. Each block contained 2 subplots, one control, the other the treatment. The position of the subplots were randomly chosen. Each 0.5m x 0.5m subplot was marked off with PVC pipes at the corners. The subplots all contained 2 sippers, one to 10cm depth, the other to 20cm depth. They also all contained 3 litter bags, each one measuring the below-ground root ingrowth at 10cm and 20cm. The 10 split-blocks were in a consecutive line, separated from each other by 1m. They were situated to be parrallel to the creek bank, in the intertidal  zone.  To examine experimentally the influence of crab burrows, the subplots designated as the controls were each counted for burrows present and the diameter of each measured. The average diameter of the burrows was found to be 1.5cm. For each controls' respective treeatment subplot, the number of burrows found in that control was doubled for its treatment plot. These burrows were added artifically by driving a 2 ft. long 1.5cm diameter PVC pipe into the substrate. A week was allotted to allow the sippers and burrows to equilibrate and the artifical burrows to be occupied. Bertness and Miller (1984) had found that greater than 75% of their artifical burrows were occupied after a week.  To asses the effects of crab burrows on sulphide, ammonia, phosphate and salinity, the sippers were sampled weekly, at rising high tide. At the end of the 9 weeks, all the Spartina alterniflora in all the subplots was cut, dried and weighed. The litter bags were removed, picked for roots, which were dried, weighed and ash dried, to find the amount of organic carbon present.  There was found to be a significant difference between the controls and treatments in sulphide concentrations (p < 0.05) and in phosphate concentrations (p < 0.25). There was a significant difference between the two different sipper depths in sulphide concentrations (p < 0.01) and in phosphate concentrations (p < 0.25). In all soil nutrients measured, a significant difference in concentrations, over the 9 week period, was found (p < 0.01). The results can be found in Table 1.  The above ground standing stock biomass was not statistically significant between the controls and treatments. However, the treatments were found to be 4% heavier than the controls. Thus, there is a trend towards an increase in biomass due to the treatment. The below-ground root ingrowth was not statistically significant between the controls and treatments, but the treatments were found to be 8.6% heavier than the controls. This may be an indication of an increase in growth due to the added burrows,  From these results, there is evidence that crab burrows do affect the sediment chemistry and plants present. The burrows do seem to enhance the production of Spartina alterniflora and to create a more favorable environment for continued burrowing and for maintaining taller-form S. alterniflora . The addition of burrows, resulting in the decrease of sulphide concentration in situ and the altering of other soil chemistry, facilitated the aeration of the soil and increased the potential production of S. alterniflora .  In all, the crabs present in the salt marsh appear to play an important role in enhancing the productivity and structure of the marshes." ;

    glview:description "The effect of Crab Burrows on Soil Nutrients and Spartina alterniflora  by Winli Lin  This study investigated the effects of fiddler crab ( Uca pugnax ) burrows on soil nutrients and the marsh grass Spartina alterniflora .  Tall-form Spartina alterniflora (1-2m tall) typically dominates the marsh area that is flooded daily by tides. The short-form S. alterniflora (<0.5m tall) generally occupies the higher tidal heights (Bertness 1985). These short-form S. alterniflora are charterized by reduced soil drainage (Mendelssohn and Senecs 1980; Howes et al. 1981; Mendelssohn et al. 1981) and increased soil sulfide levels (King et al. 1982).  From comparing control areas devoid of burrrows to those with burrows added, an increase in above-ground Spartina alterniflora production has been observed along with an increase of soil drainage rates and redox potential levels (Bertness 1985). Others have looked at how nutrient availability (Mendelssohn 1979) and sulfide accumulation (King et al. 1982; Howarth and Giblin 1983) may be the primary limiting factors controlling the production  and success of S. alterniflora . While soil water movement has been shown to influence the soil parameters, (i.e., sulfide concentration and redox potential) that directly affect cordgrass production (King et al. 1982; Koch et al. 1990), little has been studied on how biotic modifications, such as crab burrows, mediate these physical factors.  The Uca pugnax , are burrowing deposit-feeders that excavate and maintain semi-permanent burrows in the marsh surface. They have been found to not only oxygenate marsh soils (Howes et al 1981) and modify sediment meiofaunal abundance, they could also provide a suitable environment for continued burrowing and, as a byproduct, increase the marsh grass production and maintain the tall-form S. alterniflora . Uca pugnax , the  mud fiddler crab, is the dominant form of crab seen in Brownsville, VA. Their burrows are primarily restricted to areas of tall-form S. alterniflora , due to the intermediate substrate hardness and root mat density (Bertness and Miller 1985). Therefore, the effects of burrows will be more evident when studied in areas of shorter S. alterniflora with minimal burrow density.  The objective of this study was to compare areas of minimal burrow density to those with burrows added, in shorter S. alterniflora on a mainland marsh. I hypothesized that the areas with added burrows would show: (1) a decrease in soil sulfide concentration, (2) changes in other nutrient concentrations and (3) an increase in above- and below-ground growth of Spartina alterniflora .
