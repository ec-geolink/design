The modified recorder box had a mesh area to mouth opening ratio of 2.9 as opposed to < 1.0 for previous designs and the orientation of the gauze across the recorder box tunnels was horizontal instead of vertical. The modified design reduced or eliminated many of the problems observed in earlier designs.

The pressure points are mounted approx 1m below Admiralty Chart Datum (ACD) so that negative surges may be recorded and are similar in appearance to an inverted bucket with a copper nozzle mounted on the side. This nozzle is the actual measuring point. A low flow of dry air (normally 7ml/min) is fed down an air tube to the top of the pressure point. When the air pressure in the air line equals the pressure exerted by the column of water above it, then the excess air is released as bubbles through the copper nozzle.

This means that the pressure point is only immersed for half of the tidal cycle. The reason for this is that when the measuring point is exposed it can be accurately levelled into the geodetic network. Once this is accomplished the full tide pressure points can be fitted to match the tidal curve produced by the mid tide pressure point, thereby connecting them to the geodetic network."@en ;

The sonar has an oil-filled hemi-spherical plastic \"boot\" providing protection for its acoustic transducer which operates with a narrow conical beam pattern. Typically the sonar is mounted vertically, looking down at the sea-bed, and captures a sequence of profiles of the sea-bed over a pre-programmed sector and range. The sonar gathers a single swath of data in the horizontal plane and then rotates the transducer through a pre-programmed angle around the vertical axis and repeats the process until a circular area underneath the sonar has been scanned in a sequence of radial spokes. The raw data represents the signal amplitude of the envelope of the returned echoes. A suite of sensors to measure conductivity, temperature, depth, pitch and roll are also mounted on the instrument."@en ;

By measuring the time of flight of the pulse in both directions, the velocity component of the air flow along the line of the transducer pair can be determined. This measurement is carried out for each of the three transducer pairs in turn. A mathematical transformation is then performed, to convert the resulting three wind vectors into U,V,W format."@en ;

Measurement is based on the ability of selected substances to act as dynamic fluorescence quenchers. The fluorescent indicator is a special platinum porphyrin complex embedded in a gas permeable foil that is exposed to the surrounding water. A black optical isolation coating protects the complex from sunlight and fluorescent particles in the water. This sensing foil is attached to a window providing optical access for the measuring system from inside a watertight titanium housing.The foil is excited by modulated blue light, and the phase of a returned red light is measured. By linearizing and temperature compensating, with an incorporated temperature sensor, the absolute O2 concentration can be determined."@en ;

    rdfs:comment "A non-membrane dissolved oxygen sensor for marine applications. The sensor uses a platinum microelectrode and a counter electrode (thus far composed of copper). A measurement potential is applied to the microelectrode relative to a counter electrode, reducing the dissolved oxygen in the water and generating a current through the microelectrode proportional to the number of oxygen molecules at that electrode. The sensor was first used in 2000 and development is ongoing. Early versions of the instrument applied the measurement potential for up to 30 seconds, with sampling starting approximately one second after the potential was applied. The sensor response to oxygen remained almost constant for a given concentration and data could be sampled at frequencies exceeding 1 Hz. To reduce noise generated by sensitivity to flow fluctuations a mesoporous layer was used to increase the surface area of the microelectrode, but this proved unstable and was replaced by a stop-flow system which pumped water in to a very small chamber, with measurements being taken while the water was still. This significantly improved results but the sensor was still affected by small convection currents. The current version of the sensor only applies the measurement potential for a few 10s of milliseconds and data are collected at approximately 1 Hz in an attempt to minimise the effects of convection currents. The latest development is a very small sensor head containing an array of microelectrodes (currently an array of five) that work together. The counter electrode consists of silver or silver chloride. This is currently undergoing trials and is yet to be deployed on a CTD profiler."@en ;

Larger particles accelerate more slowly due to their greater inertia. Light scattered by each particle is focussed onto a photodiode. The use of twin lasers results in a two-crested signal. The peak-to-peak time-of-flight is used to determine the particle velocity, and thus its aerodynamic size.

The instrument includes airfoil shear probes (the shear sensing element comprises a piezo-ceramic bimorph beam which generates an electrical charge in response to cross-axial forces), slow and fast response thermistors, a conductivity cell, two tilt gauges and a pressure gauge. A probe guard mounted at the lower end of the instrument protects sensors from bottom sediments. Data are transmitted back to the ship in real time through a neutrally buoyant line. The FLY series of instruments was developed in the 1980s by the Institute of Ocean Sciences, British Columbia and others, and built by Sy-Tech Research Ltd of Sidney, British Columbia. The FLY IV used the same sensors as the FLY II but incorporated more advanced electronics and software. Data transmission was achieved via the TELUS Mobility Network. The instrument is no longer in production."@en ;

For marine applications, the disk is usually entirely white, while for limnological studies it is common to use one with alternating black and white quadrants. The reasons for this may be historical rather thah theoretical. A black Secchi disk has recently been developed for use in shallow rivers and streams. The disk is lowered slowly into the water on a pole or line until it can no longer be seen by the observer. The depth of disappearance provides an estimate of the transparency of the water, although any reading is affected by the observer's eyesight and ambient light conditions."@en ;

The instrument contains an 8-lamp holder with built-in power supplies for hollow cathode and electrodeless discharge lamps, allowing automatic lamp selection. The instrument uses a real-time double-beam optical system (single-beam for Zeeman furnace operation) and includes both a flame and a Transversely Heated Graphite Atomizer furnace for atomisation of the sample. The specific wavelength of light to be measured is isolated by a monochromator and absorption is measured by a solid-state detector, with a built-in low-noise CMOS charge amplifier array. The burner is equipped with a high-strength inert mixing chamber and includes an adjustable nebulizer and an all-titanium, 10-cm, single-slot burner head. The instrument has a modulated 0.8 Tesla magnetic field oriented longitudinally to the optical path and a built-in continuum source double-beam background correction for flame operation. There is also a furnace autosampler which contains a removable sample tray."@en ;

A LightPipe flowcell produces higher signal-to-noise ratio than standard flowcells, while deuterium and tungsten-halogen lamps increase light level across the full spectral range from 190-800 nm. Noise is lower than 6 uAU/cm of pathlength and a unique fiber-optic bundle creates a high resolution image with minimal light loss. The instrument was designed for use with the SpectraSYSTEM HPLC.

The probe tip includes an optic filter, beam splitter, laser beam and sapphire window, through which laser light is passed into the liquid. The light is diffracted by particles suspended in the liquid and the FBRM measures the chord length distribution (CLD), which is a function of the number, size and shape of the particles. Typically, many thousands of chords are measured per second, providing a robust measurement sensitive to the change in the size or number of particles. The instrument can be deployed on a hydrographic wire and lowered to the required depth, where is is held steady while a particle spectrum is collected. The instrument was developed by Lasentec (also known as Lasentech), which has since been taken over by Mettler Toledo. The Partec 100 is no longer in production."@en ;

Gas samples can be injected either manually, using dual-ended sample bottles with valves, or using the fully automated inlet system. Manual selection of the gas to be analysed (CH4, CO2 or N2O) dictates the route the sample will travel through the instrument. For CO2 and N2O analysis, a sample is diverted by a helium gas via the gas selector valves, through a sequence of chemical traps which purify the sample. The sample is then cryogenically frozen twice to concentrate the trace gas. The sample is then separated using the poraplot-Q gas chromatograph (GC) column, ready for analysis. During CH4 analysis, the sample is transported through additional stages including, the oxidation of CO to CO2 by a Sofnocat catalyst, combustion in the furnace and an additional cryogenic trap is used. The instrument is designed to be coupled with the IsoPrime stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS).

Instead of following the flow of the stream, the inertia of large (dense) particles causes them to hit the sides of the container and fall to the bottom, where they can be removed. The cyclone geometry and flow rate define a cut point, which is the size of the particle that will be removed from the stream with 50% efficiency.

    rdfs:comment "The ThermoQuest Finnigan Trace Mass Spectrometer (MS) is an analytical laboratory instrument that identifies and quantifies chemical compounds. An ion source converts the sample molecules into ions using Electron Ionization (EI) or Chemical Ionization (CI+ and CI-), which then pass into the quadrupole mass analyser which separates the ions, the detector then measures their mass-to-charge ratio and intensity. Pure samples may also be injected directly into the MS. The instrument is not suited to dealing with mixtures of compounds, therefore it is usually coupled with a gas chromatograph (typically a ThermoQuest Trace 2000 GC) which separates the compounds first. The Finnigan Trace MS was originally manufactured by ThermoQuest which has since been replaced by Thermo Scientific (part of Thermo Fisher Scientific). This model is no longer in production."@en ;

    rdfs:comment "A self-recording instrument with speed and direction sensors as standard and optional conductivity, temperature and pressure sensors. Speed is measured by a neutrally-buoyant styrene impeller mounted in a jewelled main thrust bearing and PTFE radial guides. Two magnets are fitted to the impeller and a reed switch fitted inside the pressure housing counts the rotations of the impeller.  Direction is sensed using a Valeport two axis, gimballed flux-gate compass.  Temperature is sensed by a Valeport platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) or thermistor, depending on the response and specification required.  Conductivity is sensed by Valeport Inductive coils and pressure by a strain-gauge transducer.   Sensor accuracy is 1.5% for speed, +/- 0.25 degrees for direction, +/-0.02C for PRT temperature, +/-0.1C for thermistor temperature, +/-0.003mS/cm for conductivity and 0.1% to 0.005% full-scale for pressure depending on sensor range.    The vector average is based on a 5 second period during which impeller counts are measured and a single compass reading is made. An average period can be any multiple of 5 seconds up to a maximum of 30 minutes. For the optional parameters, the sample is taken at the end of the sample period and averaged over the averaging period.

The instrument measures a single spatial component of turbulent velocity fluctuations, in a direction perpendicular to the probes main axis. The sensing head is based upon the design by Osborn (1974) and the sensing element consists of a parabolic, flexible rubber tip. The oncoming flow produces a hydrodynamic lift force proportional to the fluctuating cross-stream velocity component u. A piezo-ceramic beam embedded in the rubber tip translates the lift force into an electric signal that is proportional to u. The length of the sensing tip (10 mm) determines the maximum wavenumber resolution of the sensor which is approximately 48 cycles per meter. The measurements can be corrected to include wavenumbers up to 150 cpm. The sensor operates over the range 0 to 10 s^-1, has a sensitivity of 0.04 to 0.09 V m s^-2 and resolution of approximately 10 to 4 s."@en ;

HPLC forces the mobile phase under high pressures which is distinguished from traditional liquid chromatography which relies on the force of gravity. The HPLC also has better separation of the components due to the smaller particle size of the column packing material.

The compass container mass reduces the burden to the compass motor (stepping motor) which results in a follow-up speed of 30 degrees/s. The accuracy is +/-0.25 degrees for static errors and +/-0.75 degrees for dynamic errors."@en ;

This grab consists of a rectangular (but sometimes triangular) frame forming a stable support for a sampling bucket attached to a pivoted arm. On reaching the seabed, tension in the wire is released which causes the sampling bucket to pivot through 90 degrees pushing seabed sediment into the bucket. The bucket locates onto an inclined rubber-covered steel plate, sealing it completely. Weights are attached to the grab to minimize the lateral movement of the supporting frame during sample collection."@en ;

    rdfs:comment "The Aquadopp is a single-depth doppler current meter designed both for real time data collection and self contained deployments logging internally. It comes with compass, tilt, pressure and temperature sensors. It can also be configured to measure surface wave height, period and direction concurrently. It has the unique feature of being run in 'diagnostic' mode when set to collect data at 1 Hz frequency in user specified intervals. This allows studies of mooring motion and the performance of other current meters to be conducted. It can be set in various configurations with titanium housings for deployment at greater depths."@en ;

It comprises a series of modules, including a range of degassers, pumps, autosamplers and detectors. The solvent is delivered by a pump featuring a real-time pressure feedback and automatic solvent compressibility system optimized to provide accurate and precise pump flows, regardless of solvent composition. SpectraSYSTEM pumps are designed for flow rates of 10 uL to 10 mL/min (flow rate precision < 0.2% RSD) and feature excellent gradient accuracy and linearity. The SpectraSYSTEM includes an autosampler with a 120 vial capacityThe SpectraSYSTEM can be fitted with a variety of detectors, including UV/Visible (deuterium and tungsten lamps), photodiode array (deuterium and tungsten-halogen lamps) and fluorescence (pulsed xenon lamps) spectrometers. The instrument was originally manufactured by Thermo Finnigan, which was replaced by Thermo Electron and later Thermo Scientific (part of Thermo Fisher Scientific)."@en ;
